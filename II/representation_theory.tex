\section{Introduction}

Representation theory is the theory of how \emph{groups} act as groups on \emph{vector spaces}. Here
\begin{enumerate}
\item groups are either finite or compact topological groups,
\item vector spaces are finite-diemnsional and usually over \(\C\),
\item actions are linear. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Group actions}

\begin{notation}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(\F\) is a field, usually \(\C\), \(\R\) or \(\Q\). In particular \(\F\) is a field of characteristic zero. Thus in this course we mostly deal with what is known as \emph{ordinary representation theory}. Sometimes \(\F = \F_p\) or \(\cl{\F_p}\), and the study of which is known as \emph{modular representation theory}.
  \item \(V\) is a vector space over \(\F\) and will always be finite-dimensional.
  \item \(\GL(V) = \{\theta: V \to V \text{ linear invertible}\}\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{notation}

\subsection{Review of linear algebra}

If \(\dim_\F V = n\), choose basis \(e_1, \dots, e_n\) over \(\F\) so we can identify it with \(\F^n\). Then \(\theta \in \GL(V)\) correponds to an \(n \times n\) matrix \(A_\theta = (a_{ij})\), where
\[
  \theta(e_j) = \sum_i a_{ij} e_i
\]
for \(1 \leq j \leq n\). In fact we have \(A_\theta \in \GL_n(\F)\), the \emph{general linear group}. Thus

\begin{proposition}
  The map
  \begin{align*}
    \GL(V) &\to \GL_n(\F) \\
    \theta &\mapsto A_\theta
  \end{align*}
  is a group isomorphism.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Check \(A_{\theta_1\theta_2} = A_{\theta_1}A_{\theta_2}\) and bijectivity.
\end{proof}

Choosing a different basis gives different isomorphism to \(\GL_n(\F)\), but

\begin{proposition}
  Matrices \(A_1, A_2\) represent the same element of \(\GL(V)\) with respect to different basis if and only if they are \emph{conjugate} or \emph{similar}, i.e.\ exists \(X \in \GL_n(\F)\) such that \(A_2 = XA_1X^{-1}\).
\end{proposition}

Recall that the \emph{trace} of a matrix \(A\) is
\[
  \tr A = \sum_i a_{ii}.
\]

\begin{proposition}
  As \(\tr(XAX^{-1}) = \tr A\) we can define
  \[
    \tr \theta = \tr(A_\theta)
  \]
  which is \emph{independent} of the basis chosen.
\end{proposition}

Some notes on diagonalisation:

\begin{eg}
  Let \(\alpha \in \GL(V)\) where \(V\) is a finite-dimensioanl vector space over \(\C\) with \(\alpha^m = \id\) for some \(m\). Then \(\alpha\) is diagonalisable.
\end{eg}

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(V\) a finite-dimensional vector space over \(\C\) and \(\alpha \in \End(V)\). Then \(\alpha\) is diagonalisable if and only if there exists a polynomial \(f\) with distinct linear factors with \(f(\alpha) = 0\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
  In the previous example take \(f(X) = X^m - 1 = \prod_{j = 0}^{m - 1} (X - \omega^j)\) where \(\omega = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{m}}\).
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
  A finite family of commuting separately diagonalisable non-singular transformations of a \(\C\)-vector space can be simultaneously diagonalised.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Basic group theory}

We have an ample supply of basic groups:
\begin{enumerate}
\item symmetric group \(S_n = \sym(X)\) on a set \(X = \{1, \dots, n\}\) is the set of all permutations of \(X\). \(|S_n| = n!\).
\item alternating group \(A_n\) with \(|A_n| = \frac{n!}{2}\) consists of all even permutations.
\item cyclic group of order \(n\): \(C_n = \langle x: x^m = 1\rangle\). For example \((\Z/m\Z, +)\). It's also
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the group of \(m\)th root of unity in \(\C\) (which embeds to \(\GL_1(\C) = \C^*\)),
  \item the group of rotations, centre \(0\) of a regular \(m\)-gon in \(\R^2\) (which embeds to \(\GL_2(\R)\)).
  \end{itemize}
\item diahedral groups: \(D_{2m} = \langle x, y: x^m = y^2 = 1, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \rangle\) of order \(2m\). Think of this as set of rotations and reflections preserving a regular \(m\)-gon.
\item quaternion group: \(Q_8 = \langle x, y: x^4 = 1, y^2 = x^2, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \rangle\) of order \(8\). In \(\GL_2(\C)\), can put
  \[
    i =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      i & 0 \\
      0 & -i
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad
    j =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0 & 1 \\
      -1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad
     k =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0 & i \\
      i & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  then \(Q_8 = \{\pm i, \pm j, \pm k, \pm I_2\}\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}[conjugacy class, centraliser]\index{conjugacy class}\index{centraliser}
  The \emph{conjugacy class} of \(g \in G\) is
  \[
    \ccl_G(g) = \{xgx^{-1}: x \in G\}.
  \]

  Then
  \[
    |\ccl_G(g)| = |G: C_G(g)|
  \]
  where \(C_g(g) = \{x \in g: xg = gx\}\) is the \emph{centraliser} of \(g\) in \(G\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[group action]\index{group action}
  Let \(G\) be a group and \(X\) be a set. \(G\) \emph{acts} on \(X\) if there exists a map
  \begin{align*}
    G \times X &\to X \\
    (g, x) &\mapsto gx
  \end{align*}
  such that
  \begin{align*}
    1x & x \text{ for all } x \in X \\
    (gh) x & g (hx) \text{ for all } g, h \in G, x \in X
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[permutation representation]\index{representation!permutation}
  Given an action of \(G\) on \(X\), we obtain a homomorphism \(\theta: G \to \sym(X)\), called the \emph{permutation representation} of \(G\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  For \(g \in G\) the function \(\theta_g: X \to X, x \mapsto gx\) is a permutation of \(X\) (with inverse \(\theta_{g^{-1}}\). Moreover for all \(g_1, g_2 \in G\),
  \[
    \theta_{g_1 g_2} = \theta_{g_1} \theta_{g_2}
  \]
  since \((g_1g_2)x = g_1(g_2x)\) for all \(x \in X\).
\end{proof}

In this course \(X\) is often a finite-dimensional vector space over \(\F\)and the action is required to be \emph{linear}, namely
\begin{align*}
  g(v_1 + v_2) &= gv_1 + gv_2 \\
  g(\lambda v) &= \lambda g(v)
\end{align*}
for all \(v_1, v_2 \in V, g \in G, \lambda \in \F\).

\section{Basic definitions}

Let \(G\) be a finite group, \(\F\) a field.

\begin{definition}[representation]\index{representation}
  Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional vector space over \(\F\). A \emph{(linear) representation} of \(G\) on \(V\) is a group homomorphism
  \[
    \rho = \rho_V: G \to \GL(V).
  \]
  Write \(\rho_g\) for \(\rho_V(g)\).
\end{definition}
So for each \(g \in G, \rho_g \in \GL(V), \rho_1 = \id\) and \(\rho_{g_1g_2} = \rho_{g_1}\rho_{g_2}, \rho_{g_1^{-1}} = \rho_{g_1}^{-1}\).

The \emph{dimension}\index{dimension} or \emph{degree}\index{degree} of \(\rho\) is \(\dim_\F V\).

Reall that \(\ker \rho \normal G\) and \(G / \ker \rho \cong \rho(G) \leq \GL(V)\). We say \(\rho\) is \emph{faithful}\index{faithful} if \(\ker \rho = \{1\}\).

We repeat what we said in introduction, namely the correspondence between group representation and group action:

\begin{definition}[linear action]\index{action!linear}
  \(G\) acts \emph{linearly} on \(V\) if ther exists a linear action \(G \times V \to V, (g, v) \mapsto gv\) such that
  \begin{align*}
    (g_1g_2) v &= g_1(g_2v), 1 v = v \\
    g(v_1 + v_2) &= gv_1 gv_2, g(\lambda v) = \lambda g(v)
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

Now if \(G\) acts on \(V\), the map
\begin{align*}
  G &\to \GL(V) \\
  g &\mapsto \rho_g
\end{align*}
with \(\rho_g: v \mapsto gv\) is a representation. Conversely, given a representation \(G \to \GL(V)\) we have a linear action of \(G\) on \(V\) via
\[
  gv = \rho(g)(v).
\]

\begin{remark}
  We also say that \(V\) is a \emph{\(G\)-space}\index{\(G\)-space} or that \(V\) is a \emph{\(G\)-module}\index{\(G\)-module}. This use of ``module'' might seen unconventional but if fact if you define the \emph{group algebra}\index{group algebra}
  \[
    \F G = \left\{ \sum_{g\in G} \alpha_g g: \alpha_g \in \F \right\}
  \]
  with natural addition an multiplication, then \(V\) is an \(\F G\)-module. \(\F G\) is an example of \emph{\(\F\)-algebra}, i.e.\ a ring which is also an \(\F\)-module such that multiplication is bilinear.
\end{remark}

If we bring in a basis for \(V\), we get yet another equivalent definition:

\begin{definition}[matrix representation]\index{matrix representation}
  \(R\) is a \emph{matrix representation} of \(G\) of degree \(n\) if \(R\) is a homomorphism \(G \to \GL_n(\F)\).
\end{definition}

Given a linear representation \(\rho: G \to \GL(V)\) with \(\dim_FV = n\), fix a basis \(\mathcal B\) then we get a matrix representation
\begin{align*}
  G &\to \GL_n(\F) \\
  g &\mapsto [\rho(g)]_{\mathcal B}
\end{align*}
Conversely, given a matrix representation \(R: G \to \GL_n(\F)\), you get a linear representation
\begin{align*}
  \rho: G &\to \GL(\F^n) \\
  g &\mapsto \rho_g
\end{align*}
via \(\rho_g(v) = R_g(v)\).

\begin{eg}
  Given any group \(G\), take \(V = \F\) (the \(1\) dimensional space) and
  \begin{align*}
    \rho: G &\to \GL(V) \\
    g &\mapsto \id_V
  \end{align*}
  is known as the \emph{trivial representation}\index{representation!trivial}. \(\deg \rho = 1\).
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  Let \(G = C_4 = \langle x: x^4 = 1 \rangle\). Take \(\F = \C\) and let \(n = 2\). Then \(R: x \mapsto X\) will determine \(x^j \mapsto X^j\) and thus the matrix representation \(R\). We need \(X^4 = I\). We can take
  \begin{itemize}
  \item either \(X\) diagonal: any such with diagonal entries in \(\{\pm 1, \pm i\}\) (16 choices),
  \item or \(X\) is not diagonal: then it will be conjugate to a diagonal (by diagonalisability criterion).
  \end{itemize}
\end{eg}

\subsection{Equivalent representations}

\begin{definition}[\(G\)-homomorphism, \(G\)-isomorphism]\index{\(G\)-homomorphism}\index{interwining homomorphism}\index{isomorphic}\index{equivalent}
  Fix \(G\) and \(\F\). Let \(V\) and \(V'\) be \(\F\)-vector spaces and \(\rho: G \to \GL(V), \rho': G \to \GL(V')\) be representations of \(G\). The linear map \(\varphi: V \to V'\) is a \emph{\(G\)-homomorphism} or \emph{interwining homomorphism} if
  \[
    \varphi \rho(g) = \rho'(g) \varphi.
  \]
  In other words, the following diagram commutes:
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      V \ar[r, "\rho_g"] \ar[d, "\varphi"] & V \ar[d, "\varphi"] \\
      V' \ar[r, "\rho_g'"] & V'
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]

  We say \(\varphi\) \emph{intertwines} \(\rho\) and \(\rho'\). Write \(\hom_G(V, V')\) for the \(\F\)-space of all such.

  \(\varphi\) is a \emph{\(G\)-isomorphism} if \(\varphi\) is also bijective. If such a \(\varphi\) exists, say \(\rho\) and \(\rho'\) are \emph{isomorphic} or \emph{equivalent}. If \(\varphi\) is a \(G\)-isomorphism we can write the interwinding condition as
  \[
    \rho' = \varphi \rho \varphi^{-1}.
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  Being isomorphic is an equivalence relation on the set of all representations of \(G\) over \(\F\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Exercise.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  If \(\rho\) and \(\rho'\) are isomorphic representation then they have the same dimension. The converse is false:  \(C_4\) has four non-isomorphic \(1\) dimensional representations.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Given \(G, V, \F\) with \(\dim_\F V = n\) and \(\rho: G \to \GL(V)\), fix a basis \(\mathcal B\) of \(V\). We get an isomorphism
  \begin{align*}
    \varphi: V &\to \F^n \\
    v &\mapsto [v]_{\mathcal B}
  \end{align*}
  And \(\varphi\) gives a representation \(\rho': G \to \GL(\F^n)\) isomorphic to \(\rho\).
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Transformations in terms of matrix representatives: \(R: G \to \GL_n(\F), R': G \to \GL_n(\F)\) are \(G\)-isomorphic or \(G\)-equivalent if exists \(X \in \GL_n(\F)\) with
    \[
      R'(g) = XR(g)X^{-1}
    \]
    for all \(g \in G\).
  \item In terms of linear \(G\)-actions, the action of \(G\) on \(V, V'\) are \(G\)-isomorphic if there exists \(\varphi: V \to V'\) such that
    \[
      g\varphi(v) = \varphi(gv)
    \]
    for all \(g \in G, v \in V\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Subrepresentation}

\begin{definition}[\(G\)-subspace]\index{\(G\)-subspace}
  Let \(\rho: G \to \GL(V)\) be a representation of \(G\). We say that \(W \leq V\) is a \emph{\(G\)-subspace} if it is a subspace and it is \(\rho(G)\)-invariant, i.e.\ \(\rho_g(W) \subseteq W\) for all \(g \in G\).
\end{definition}

Obviously \(\{0\}\) and \(V\) are \(G\)-subspaces. On the other hand,

\begin{definition}[irreducible/simple representation]\index{representation!irreducible}\index{representation!simple}
  \(\rho\) is said to be \emph{irreducible} or \emph{simple} representation if there are no proper \(G\)-subspaces.
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
  Any 1 dimensional representation of \(G\) is irreducible. The converse is not true. For example \(D_8\) has a 2 dimensional irreducible representation.
\end{eg}

\begin{definition}[subrepresentation]\index{subrepresentation}
  If \(W\) is a \(G\)-subspace then the corresponding map
  \begin{align*}
    G &\to \GL(W) \\
    g &\mapsto \rho(g)|_W
  \end{align*}
  is a representation of \(G\), known as a \emph{subrepresentation} of \(\rho\).
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  If \(\rho: G \to \GL(V)\) is a representation, \(W\) is a \(G\)-subspace of \(V\) and \(\mathcal B = \{v_1, \dots, v_n\}\) is a basis containing a basis \(\{v_1, \dots, v_m\}\) of \(W\), where \(0 < m \leq n\), then the matrix of \(\rho(g)\) with respect to \(\mathcal B\) has block upper triangular form
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      * & * \\
      0 & *
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  for each \(g \in G\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{eg}
  Let \(\F = \C\).
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Irreducible representation of \(C_4 = \langle x: x^4 = 1\rangle\) are all 1 dimensional and four of them are
    \[
      x \mapsto i, x \mapsto -1, x \mapsto -i, x \mapsto 1.
    \]

    In general \(C_m\) has precisely \(m\) inequivalent complex irreducible representations, all of degree 1. Actually all complex irreducible representations of a \emph{finite abelian group} are 1 dimensional, by simultaneous diagonalisation and primary decomposition. Alternatively, this follows from Schur's lemma\index{Schur's lemma}.
  \item \(G = D_6\): every irreducible \(\C\)-representation has dimension \(\leq 2\). Let \(\rho: G \to \GL(V)\) be an irreducible representation of \(G\). Let \(r\) be a rotation and \(s\) be reflection. Take an eigenvector \(v\) of \(\rho(r)\) so \(\rho(r)v = \lambda v\) for some \(\lambda \in \C, \lambda \neq 0\). Let
    \[
      W = \langle v, \rho(s) v \rangle \leq V.
    \]
    Since
    \begin{align*}
      \rho(s)\rho(s) v &= v \\
      \rho(r)\rho(s) v &= \rho(s)\rho(r)^{-1}v = \lambda^{-1}\rho(s)v
    \end{align*}
    so \(W\) is \(G\)-invariant. Since \(V\) is irreducible \(W = V\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{eg}

\begin{definition}[(in)decomposable representation, direct sum]\index{representation!decomposable}\index{representation!direct sum}\index{representation!indecomposable}
  We say that \(\rho: G \to \GL(V)\) is \emph{decomposable} if there are proper \(G\)-invariant subspaces \(U, W\) with \(V = U \oplus W\). Say \(\rho\) is the \emph{direct sum} \(\rho_U \oplus \rho_W\). If no such subspaces exist we say \(\rho\) is \emph{indecomposable}.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  If \(\rho: G \to \GL(V)\) is decomposable, \(\mathcal B = \{v_1, \dots, v_k, w_1, \dots, w_\ell\}\) is a basis of \(V\) consisting of a basis of \(U\) and a basis of \(W\), then \(\rho(g)\) with respect to \(\mathcal B\) is block diagonal for all \(g \in G\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}[direct sum]\index{representation!direct sum}
  Let \(\rho: G \to \GL(V), \rho': G \to \GL(V')\) be two representations. The \emph{direct sum} of \(\rho, \rho'\) is
  \begin{align*}
    \rho \oplus \rho': G &\to \GL(V \oplus V') \\
    (\rho \oplus \rho') (g) (v + v') &= \rho(g) v + \rho'(g) v'
  \end{align*}

  For matrix representations \(R: G \to \GL_n(\F), R': G \to \GL_{n'}(\F)\), define \(R \oplus R': G \to \GL_{n + n'}(\F)\) is given by
  \[
    g \mapsto
    \begin{pmatrix}
      R(g) & 0 \\
      0 & R'(g)
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  for all \(g\).
\end{definition}

\section{Complete reducibility and Maschke's theorem}

Given \(G, \F\) as usual.

\begin{definition}[completely reducible/semisimple representation]\index{representation!completely reducible}\index{representation!semisimple}
  A representation \(\rho: G \to \GL(V)\) is \emph{completely reducible} or \emph{semisimple} if it is a direct sum of irreducible representations.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  Irreducible implies completely reducible. The converse is not true. See example sheet 1 question 3.
\end{remark}

From now on take \(G\) to be finite and \(\ch F = 0\) throughout this chapter.

\begin{theorem}[complete reducibility theorem]\index{complete reduciblity theorem}
  \label{thm:complete reducibility theorem}
  Every finite-dimensional representation \(V\) of a finite group over a field of characteristic \(0\) is completely reducible, i.e.\ \(V = V_1 \oplus \dots \oplus V_r\) is a direct sum of representations with each \(V_i\) irreducible.
\end{theorem}

In fact it is enough to prove

\begin{theorem}[Maschke]\index{Maschke's theorem}
  \label{thm:Maschke}
  Suppose \(G\) is finite and \(\rho: G \to \GL(V)\) is a representation with \(V\) finite-dimensional, \(\ch F = 0\). If \(W\) is a \(G\)-subspace of \(V\) then there exists a \(G\)-subspace \(U\) of \(V\) such that \(V = W \oplus U\), a direct sum of \(G\)-subspaces.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(W'\) be any complementary subspace of \(W\) in \(V\), i.e.\ \(V = W \oplus W'\). Let \(q: V \to W\) be the projection of \(V\) onto \(W\) along \(W'\), i.e.\ if \(v = w + w'\) then \(q(v) = w\). Define
  \[
    \overline q: v \mapsto \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g q(g^{-1}(v)),
  \]
  the ``average of \(q\) over \(G\)''. Note that we've dropped the \(\rho\) in \(\rho(g)\) and \(\rho(g^{-1})\) to avoid excessive notations.

  Claim that \(\overline q: V \to W\): for \(v \in V\), \(q(g^{-1}(v)) \in W\) and \(g(W) \subseteq W\). Also \(\overline q(w) = w\) for \(w \in W\) as
  \[
    \overline q(w)
    = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g q(g^{-1}w)
    = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} g (g^{-1}w)
    = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} w
    = w
  \]
  Thus \(\overline q\) projects \(V\) onto \(W\).

  As \(\overline q\) is a projection we can write \(V = \im \overline q \oplus \ker \overline q = W \oplus \ker \overline q\). Need to show \(\ker \overline q\) is \(G\)-invariant. Note that if \(h \in G\)
  \begin{align*}
    h \overline q(v)
    &= h \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_g g q(g^{-1}v) \\
    &= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_g hg q(g^{-1}v) \\
    &= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_g (hg) q((hg)^{-1} hv) \\
    &= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_g g q(g^{-1}(hv)) \\
    &= \overline q(hv).
  \end{align*}

  Thus if \(v \in \ker \overline q, h \in G\) then
  \[
    h\overline q(v) = 0 = \overline q(hv)
  \]
  so \(hv \in \ker \overline q\). Therefore
  \[
    V = \im \overline q \oplus \ker \overline q = W \oplus \ker \overline q
  \]
  which is a \(G\)-subspace decomposition.
\end{proof}

In fact, we only need \(\ch \F \ndivides |G|\).

\begin{remark}
  Complements are not unique. For example, take \(G = 1\). Then a representation of \(G\) is just a vector space. Take \(V = \C^2\). Then any proper subspace \(W \leq V\) will do.
\end{remark}

\begin{ex}
  Deduce \nameref{thm:complete reducibility theorem} from \nameref{thm:Maschke} by induction on dimension.
\end{ex}

We'll present another proof using inner product. This will generalise easily to compact Lie groups. Take \(\F = \C\).

Recall that for \(V\) a \(\C\)-vector space. \(\ip{\cdot, \cdot}\) is a \emph{Hermitian inner product}\index{inner product} if
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(\ip{w, v} = \conj{\ip{v, w}}\) for all \(v, w\).
\item sesquilinear: linear in second argument.
\item positive definite \(\ip{v, v} > 0\) if \(v = 0\).
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore \(\ip{\cdot, \cdot}\) is \emph{\(G\)-invariant} if
\[
  \ip{gv, gw} = {v, w}
\]
for all \(v, w \in V, g \in G\).

If \(W\) is a \(G\)-invariant subspace of \(V\) (with a \(G\)-invariant inner product) then \(W^\perp\) is also \(G\)-invariant and \(W = W \oplus W^\perp\): enough to show for all \(v \in W^\perp, g \in G\), have \(gv \in W^\perp\). But by definition \(\ip{v, w} = 0\) for all \(w \in W\). Thus by \(G\)-invariance \(\ip{gv, gw} = 0\) for all \(g\). Certainly \(\ip{gv, w'} = 0\) for all \(w' \in W\) as we can choose \(w = g^{-1}w' \in W\). The result thus follows.

Therefore if there is a \(G\)-invariant inner product on any complex \(G\)-space then we get another proof of Maschke's theorem.

\begin{lemma}[Weyl's unitary trick]\index{Weyl's unitary trick}
  Let \(\rho\) be a complex representation of a finite group \(G\) on the \(\C\)-vector space \(V\). Then there is a \(G\)-invariant inner product on \(V\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  There exists an inner product on \(V\): take basis \(e_1, \dots, e_n\) and define \((e_i, e_j) = \delta_{ij}\). Extend sesquilinearly. Now define
  \[
    \ip{v, w} = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_g (gv, gw).
  \]
  Easy exercise that \(\ip{\cdot, \cdot}\) is a \(G\)-invariant inner product. For example for \(G\)-invariance, for all \(h \in G\),
  \begin{align*}
    \ip{hv, hw}
    &= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_g ((gh)v, (gh)w) \\
    &= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g'} (g'v, g'w) \\
    &= \ip{v, w}
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  Every finite subgroup of \(\GL_n(\C)\) is conjugate to a subgroup of \(U(n)\).

\begin{definition}[regular representation]\index{representation!regular}
  Recall group algebra of \(G\) is the \(\F\)-space
  \[
    \F G = \text{span} \{e_g: g \in G\}.
  \]
  There is a linear \(G\)-action
  \[
    h . \sum_g a_ge_g = \sum_g a_g e_{hg} = \sum_{g'} a_{h^{-1}g'} e_{g'}.
  \]
  This is known as \emph{regular representation} of \(G\), denoted \(\rho_{\text{reg}}\).
\end{definition}

This is a faithful representation of dimension \(|G|\). We call \(V = \F G\) (sometimes also written \(\F[G]\)) the \emph{regular module}\index{regular module}.

It turns out that every irreducible representation of \(G\) is a subrepresentation of \(\rho_{\text{reg}}\):

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(\rho\) be an irreducible representation of \(G\) over a field of characteristic \(0\). Then \(\rho\) is isomorphic to a subrepresentation of \(\rho_{\text{reg}}\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(\rho: G \to \GL(V)\) be irreducible and let \(v \in V\) nonzero. Consider
  \begin{align*}
    \theta: \F G &\to V \\
    \sum_g a_g e_g &\mapsto \sum_g a_g gv
  \end{align*}
  This is a \(G\)-homomorphism. Now \(V\) is irreducible and \(\im \theta = V\) since \(\im \theta\) is a \(G\)-subspace. Then \(\ker \theta\) is a \(G\)-subspace of \(\F G\). Let \(W\) be a \(G\)-complement of \(\ker \theta\) in \(\F G\). Thus
  \[
    W \cong \F G/ \ker \theta \cong \im \theta = V.
  \]
\end{proof}
