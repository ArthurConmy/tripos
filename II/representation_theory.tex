\section{Introduction}

Representation theory is the theory of how \emph{groups} act as groups on \emph{vector spaces}. Here
\begin{enumerate}
\item groups are either finite or compact topological groups,
\item vector spaces are finite-diemnsional and usually over \(\C\),
\item actions are linear. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Group actions}

\begin{notation}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(\F\) is a field, usually \(\C\), \(\R\) or \(\Q\). In particular \(\F\) is a field of characteristic zero. Thus in this course we mostly deal with what is known as \emph{ordinary representation theory}. Sometimes \(\F = \F_p\) or \(\cl{\F_p}\), and the study of which is known as \emph{modular representation theory}.
  \item \(V\) is a vector space over \(\F\) and will always be finite-dimensional.
  \item \(\GL(V) = \{\theta: V \to V \text{ linear invertible}\}\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{notation}

\subsection{Review of linear algebra}

If \(\dim_\F V = n\), choose basis \(e_1, \dots, e_n\) over \(\F\) so we can identify it with \(\F^n\). Then \(\theta \in \GL(V)\) correponds to an \(n \times n\) matrix \(A_\theta = (a_{ij})\), where
\[
  \theta(e_j) = \sum_i a_{ij} e_i
\]
for \(1 \leq j \leq n\). In fact we have \(A_\theta \in \GL_n(\F)\), the \emph{general linear group}. Thus

\begin{proposition}
  The map
  \begin{align*}
    \GL(V) &\to \GL_n(\F) \\
    \theta &\mapsto A_\theta
  \end{align*}
  is a group isomorphism.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Check \(A_{\theta_1\theta_2} = A_{\theta_1}A_{\theta_2}\) and bijectivity.
\end{proof}

Choosing a different basis gives different isomorphism to \(\GL_n(\F)\), but

\begin{proposition}
  Matrices \(A_1, A_2\) represent the same element of \(\GL(V)\) with respect to different basis if and only if they are \emph{conjugate} or \emph{similar}, i.e.\ exists \(X \in \GL_n(\F)\) such that \(A_2 = XA_1X^{-1}\).
\end{proposition}

Recall that the \emph{trace} of a matrix \(A\) is
\[
  \tr A = \sum_i a_{ii}.
\]

\begin{proposition}
  As \(\tr(XAX^{-1}) = \tr A\) we can define
  \[
    \tr \theta = \tr(A_\theta)
  \]
  which is \emph{independent} of the basis chosen.
\end{proposition}

Some notes on diagonalisation:

\begin{eg}
  Let \(\alpha \in \GL(V)\) where \(V\) is a finite-dimensioanl vector space over \(\C\) with \(\alpha^m = \id\) for some \(m\). Then \(\alpha\) is diagonalisable.
\end{eg}

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(V\) a finite-dimensional vector space over \(\C\) and \(\alpha \in \End(V)\). Then \(\alpha\) is diagonalisable if and only if there exists a polynomial \(f\) with distinct linear factors with \(f(\alpha) = 0\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
  In the previous example take \(f(X) = X^m - 1 = \prod_{j = 0}^{m - 1} (X - \omega^j)\) where \(\omega = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{m}}\).
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
  A finite family of commuting separately diagonalisable non-singular transformations of a \(\C\)-vector space can be simultaneously diagonalised.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Basic group theory}

We have an ample supply of basic groups:
\begin{enumerate}
\item symmetric group \(S_n = \sym(X)\) on a set \(X = \{1, \dots, n\}\) is the set of all permutations of \(X\). \(|S_n| = n!\).
\item alternating group \(A_n\) with \(|A_n| = \frac{n!}{2}\) consists of all even permutations.
\item cyclic group of order \(n\): \(C_n = \langle x: x^m = 1\rangle\). For example \((\Z/m\Z, +)\). It's also
  \begin{itemize}
  \item the group of \(m\)th root of unity in \(\C\) (which embeds to \(\GL_1(\C) = \C^*\)),
  \item the group of rotations, centre \(0\) of a regular \(m\)-gon in \(\R^2\) (which embeds to \(\GL_2(\R)\)).
  \end{itemize}
\item diahedral groups: \(D_{2m} = \langle x, y: x^m = y^2 = 1, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \rangle\) of order \(2m\). Think of this as set of rotations and reflections preserving a regular \(m\)-gon.
\item quaternion group: \(Q_8 = \langle x, y: x^4 = 1, y^2 = x^2, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \rangle\) of order \(8\). In \(\GL_2(\C)\), can put
  \[
    i =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      i & 0 \\
      0 & -i
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad
    j =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0 & 1 \\
      -1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    \quad
     k =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      0 & i \\
      i & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  then \(Q_8 = \{\pm i, \pm j, \pm k, \pm I_2\}\).
\end{enumerate}

\begin{definition}[conjugacy class, centraliser]\index{conjugacy class}\index{centraliser}
  The \emph{conjugacy class} of \(g \in G\) is
  \[
    \ccl_G(g) = \{xgx^{-1}: x \in G\}.
  \]

  Then
  \[
    |\ccl_G(g)| = |G: C_G(g)|
  \]
  where \(C_g(g) = \{x \in g: xg = gx\}\) is the \emph{centraliser} of \(g\) in \(G\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[group action]\index{group action}
  Let \(G\) be a group and \(X\) be a set. \(G\) \emph{acts} on \(X\) if there exists a map
  \begin{align*}
    G \times X &\to X \\
    (g, x) &\mapsto gx
  \end{align*}
  such that
  \begin{align*}
    1x & x \text{ for all } x \in X \\
    (gh) x & g (hx) \text{ for all } g, h \in G, x \in X
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[permutation representation]\index{representation!permutation}
  Given an action of \(G\) on \(X\), we obtain a homomorphism \(\theta: G \to \sym(X)\), called the \emph{permutation representation} of \(G\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  For \(g \in G\) the function \(\theta_g: X \to X, x \mapsto gx\) is a permutation of \(X\) (with inverse \(\theta_{g^{-1}}\). Moreover for all \(g_1, g_2 \in G\),
  \[
    \theta_{g_1 g_2} = \theta_{g_1} \theta_{g_2}
  \]
  since \((g_1g_2)x = g_1(g_2x)\) for all \(x \in X\).
\end{proof}

In this course \(X\) is often a finite-dimensional vector space over \(\F\)and the action is required to be \emph{linear}, namely
\begin{align*}
  g(v_1 + v_2) &= gv_1 + gv_2 \\
  g(\lambda v) &= \lambda g(v)
\end{align*}
for all \(v_1, v_2 \in V, g \in G, \lambda \in \F\).

\section{Basic definitions}

Let \(G\) be a finite group, \(\F\) a field.

\begin{definition}[representation]\index{representation}
  Let \(V\) be a finite-dimensional vector space over \(\F\). A \emph{(linear) representation} of \(G\) on \(V\) is a group homomorphism
  \[
    \rho = \rho_V: G \to \GL(V).
  \]
  Write \(\rho_g\) for \(\rho_V(g)\).
\end{definition}
So for each \(g \in G, \rho_g \in \GL(V), \rho_1 = \id\) and \(\rho_{g_1g_2} = \rho_{g_1}\rho_{g_2}, \rho_{g_1^{-1}} = \rho_{g_1}^{-1}\).

The \emph{dimension}\index{dimension} or \emph{degree}\index{degree} of \(\rho\) is \(\dim_\F V\).

Reall that \(\ker \rho \normal G\) and \(G / \ker \rho \cong \rho(G) \leq \GL(V)\). We say \(\rho\) is \emph{faithful}\index{faithful} if \(\ker \rho = \{1\}\).

We repeat what we said in introduction, namely the correspondence between group representation and group action:

\begin{definition}[linear action]\index{action!linear}
  \(G\) acts \emph{linearly} on \(V\) if ther exists a linear action \(G \times V \to V, (g, v) \mapsto gv\) such that
  \begin{align*}
    (g_1g_2) v &= g_1(g_2v), 1 v = v \\
    g(v_1 + v_2) &= gv_1 gv_2, g(\lambda v) = \lambda g(v)
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

Now if \(G\) acts on \(V\), the map
\begin{align*}
  G &\to \GL(V) \\
  g &\mapsto \rho_g
\end{align*}
with \(\rho_g: v \mapsto gv\) is a representation. Conversely, given a representation \(G \to \GL(V)\) we have a linear action of \(G\) on \(V\) via
\[
  gv = \rho(g)(v).
\]

\begin{remark}
  We also say that \(V\) is a \emph{\(G\)-space}\index{\(G\)-space} or that \(V\) is a \emph{\(G\)-module}\index{\(G\)-module}. This use of ``module'' might seen unconventional but if fact if you define the \emph{group algebra}\index{group algebra}
  \[
    \F G = \left\{ \sum_{g\in G} \alpha_g g: \alpha_g \in \F \right\}
  \]
  with natural addition an multiplication, then \(V\) is an \(\F G\)-module. \(\F G\) is an example of \emph{\(\F\)-algebra}, i.e.\ a ring which is also an \(\F\)-module such that multiplication is bilinear.
\end{remark}

If we bring in a basis for \(V\), we get yet another equivalent definition:

\begin{definition}[matrix representation]\index{matrix representation}
  \(R\) is a \emph{matrix representation} of \(G\) of degree \(n\) if \(R\) is a homomorphism \(G \to \GL_n(\F)\).
\end{definition}

Given a linear representation \(\rho: G \to \GL(V)\) with \(\dim_FV = n\), fix a basis \(\mathcal B\) then we get a matrix representation
\begin{align*}
  G &\to \GL_n(\F) \\
  g &\mapsto [\rho(g)]_{\mathcal B}
\end{align*}
Conversely, given a matrix representation \(R: G \to \GL_n(\F)\), you get a linear representation
\begin{align*}
  \rho: G &\to \GL(\F^n) \\
  g &\mapsto \rho_g
\end{align*}
via \(\rho_g(v) = R_g(v)\).

\begin{eg}
  Given any group \(G\), take \(V = \F\) (the \(1\) dimensional space) and
  \begin{align*}
    \rho: G &\to \GL(V) \\
    g &\mapsto \id_V
  \end{align*}
  is known as the \emph{trivial representation}\index{representation!trivial}. \(\deg \rho = 1\).
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  Let \(G = C_4 = \langle x: x^4 = 1 \rangle\). Take \(\F = \C\) and let \(n = 2\). Then \(R: x \mapsto X\) will determine \(x^j \mapsto X^j\) and thus the matrix representation \(R\). We need \(X^4 = I\). We can take
  \begin{itemize}
  \item either \(X\) diagonal: any such with diagonal entries in \(\{\pm 1, \pm i\}\) (16 choices),
  \item or \(X\) is not diagonal: then it will be conjugate to a diagonal (by diagonalisability criterion).
  \end{itemize}
\end{eg}

\subsection{Equivalent representations}

\begin{definition}[\(G\)-homomorphism, \(G\)-isomorphism]\index{\(G\)-homomorphism}\index{interwining homomorphism}\index{isomorphic}\index{equivalent}
  Fix \(G\) and \(\F\). Let \(V\) and \(V'\) be \(\F\)-vector spaces and \(\rho: G \to \GL(V), \rho': G \to \GL(V')\) be representations of \(G\). The linear map \(\varphi: V \to V'\) is a \emph{\(G\)-homomorphism} or \emph{interwining homomorphism} if
  \[
    \varphi \rho(g) = \rho'(g) \varphi.
  \]
  In other words, the following diagram commutes:
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      V \ar[r, "\rho_g"] \ar[d, "\varphi"] & V \ar[d, "\varphi"] \\
      V' \ar[r, "\rho_g'"] & V'
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]

  We say \(\varphi\) \emph{intertwines} \(\rho\) and \(\rho'\). Write \(\hom_G(V, V')\) for the \(\F\)-space of all such.

  \(\varphi\) is a \emph{\(G\)-isomorphism} if \(\varphi\) is also bijective. If such a \(\varphi\) exists, say \(\rho\) and \(\rho'\) are \emph{isomorphic} or \emph{equivalent}. If \(\varphi\) is a \(G\)-isomorphism we can write the interwinding condition as
  \[
    \rho' = \varphi \rho \varphi^{-1}.
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  Being isomorphic is an equivalence relation on the set of all representations of \(G\) over \(\F\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Exercise.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  If \(\rho\) and \(\rho'\) are isomorphic representation then they have the same dimension. The converse is false:  \(C_4\) has four non-isomorphic \(1\) dimensional representations.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Given \(G, V, \F\) with \(\dim_\F V = n\) and \(\rho: G \to \GL(V)\), fix a basis \(\mathcal B\) of \(V\). We get an isomorphism
  \begin{align*}
    \varphi: V &\to \F^n \\
    v &\mapsto [v]_{\mathcal B}
  \end{align*}
  Get a representation \(\rho': G \to \GL(\F^n)\) isomorphic to \(\rho\).
\end{remark}
