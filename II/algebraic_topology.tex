\section{Introduction}

\begin{question}
  Is the Hopf link really linked? More formally, is there a homeomorphism \(\R^3 \to \R^3\) taking \(H\) to \(U\)?
\end{question}

\(H\) can be realised as \(S^1 \amalg S^1 \to \R^3\). For \(U\), we can consider \(S^1 \amalg S^1\) as boundary of \(D^1 \amalg D^1\) and the map extends to a map to discs.

So it makes sense to phrase the question as

\begin{question}
  Does the Hopf link \(\eta: S^1 \amalg S^1 \to \R^3\)extend to a map of discs?
\end{question}

This is an example of an \emph{extension problem}.

Here is another example. Define the \(n\)-sphere \(S^{n - 1} := \{x \in \R^n: \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 = 1\}\), which sits inside \(D^n = \{x \in \R^n: \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 = 1\}\). We can ask:

\begin{question}
  Does the identity map \(\id_{S^{n - 1}}: S^{n - 1} \to S^{n - 1}\) factor through \(D^n\)?
\end{question}

To gain some intuition, let's consider small \(n\). For \(n = 1\), \(S^0 = \{-1, 1\}\). The answer is no by Intermediate Value Theorem, or connectedness from topology. For \(n = 2\), this answer is again no by winding number argument. What about \(n \geq 3\)?

These problems are hard because we have to consider continuous maps between two spaces, which are in general very big and hard to compute. On the other hand, a comparable algebraic problem is

\begin{question}
  Does the map \(\id: \Z \to \Z\) factor through \(0\)?
\end{question}

Well that's much much easier!

\section{The Fundamental Group}

Throughout this course, ``maps'' mean continuous maps.

\subsection{Deforming maps and spaces}

\begin{definition}[homotopy]\index{homotopy}
  Let \(f_0, f_1: X \to Y\) be maps. A \emph{homotopy} between \(f_0\) and \(f_1\) is a map \(F: X \times [0, 1] \to X\) such that \(F(x, 0) = f_0(x)\) and \(F(x, 1) = f_1(x)\) for all \(x \in X\).

  If \(F\) exists, we say that \(f_0\) is \emph{homotopic} to \(f_1\) and write \(f_0 \simeq f_1\), or to emphasise the homotopy, \(f_0 \simeq_F f_1\).
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}
  \(I = [0, 1]\). We often write \(f_t(x) = F(x, t)\).
\end{notation}

\begin{eg}
  If \(Y\) is a convex region in \(\R^n\) then for any \(f_0, f_1: X \to Y\), the \emph{straight-line homotopy} \(F(x, y) = t f_1(x) + (1 - t) f_0(x)\) is a homotopy \(f_0 \simeq f_1\).
\end{eg}

\begin{definition}[relative homotopy]
  If \(Z \subseteq X\) and \(F(z, t) = f_0(z) = f_1(z)\) for all \(z \in Z, t \in I\), then \(F\) is a \emph{homotopy relative to \(Z\)}, write \(f_0 \simeq_F f_1 \rel Z\).
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
  The relation \(\simeq\) (\(\rel Z\)) is an equivalence relation on maps \(X \to Y\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Reflexivity and symmetry are easy. For transitivity, suppose \(f_0 \simeq_{F_0} f_1 \simeq_{F_1} f_2\). Let
  \[
    F(x, t) =
    \begin{cases}
      F_0(x, 2t) & t \leq \frac{1}{2} \\
      F_1(x, 2t - 1) & t \geq \frac{1}{2}
    \end{cases}
  \]
  which is the homotopy we need.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[homotopy equivalence]\index{homotopy equivalence}
  \(f: X \to Y\) and \(g: Y \to X\) is a \emph{homotopy equivalence} if \(g \compose f \simeq \id_X\) and \(f \compose g \simeq \id_Y\). In this case we say \(X\) is homotopy equivalent to \(Y\) and write \(X \simeq Y\).
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
  Let \(X = *\), the space with one point and \(Y = \R^n\). Let \(f: * \mapsto 0\), \(g\) be the unique map \(Y \to X\). Then \(g \compose f = \id_X\), and \(f \compose g = 0 \simeq \id_Y\) via the straightline homotopy. Therefore \(\R^n\) is homotopy equivalent to \(*\).
\end{eg}

\begin{definition}[contractible]\index{contractible}
  A space \(X\) is \emph{contractible} if \(X \simeq *\).
\end{definition}
