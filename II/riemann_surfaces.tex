\section{Complex analysis \& Branching/Multivalued functions}

\subsection{Holomorphicity}

\begin{definition}
  A smooth function \(f: U \to \C\) from a domain (i.e.\ an open connected subset of \(\C\)) is \emph{holomorphic} or \emph{analytic} if either of the following holds:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(f\) is differentiable in the sense of limits (which is equivalent to satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations),
  \item for each \(a \in U\), \(f\) has a power series expansion
    \[
      f(z) = \sum_{n \geq 0} a_n (z - a)^n,
    \]
    valid on some disk \(D(a, r)\) with positive radius \(r > 0\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  1 implies 2 since \(f\) being differentiable allows us to construct \(a_n\) using Cauchy Integral Formula. 2 implies 1 since \(f\) having power series allows term-by-term differentiation.
\end{remark}

By 2, if \(a \in U\) and \(f\) is not identically \(0\) near \(a\), then there exists some minimal \(m \geq 0\) such that \(a_m \neq 0\). It follows that \(f(z) = a_m (z - a)^m (1 + g(z - a))\) where \(\lim_{z \to a} g(z - a) = 0\). Therefore for \(z\) sufficiently close to \(a\), \(f\) is nonzero. This is known as

\begin{theorem}[Principle of isolated zeros]
  An analytic function on a domain \(U\) which is not identically zero has isolated zeros, i.e.\ around each \(a \in U\), there exists a disk \(\Delta_a\) on which \(f(z) \neq 0\) unless possibly at \(z = a\).
\end{theorem}

If \(f\) is identically \(0\) near \(a\), then there exists a disk \(\Delta_a\) on which \(f(z) = 0\) for all \(z \in \Delta_a\). Consider \(V := \bigcup_{a: f|_{\Delta_a} = 0} \Delta_a\) and \(W := \bigcup_{a: f \neq 0 \text{ near } a} \Delta_a\). \(V\) and \(W\) are open and disjoint so by connectivity of \(U\), one of them is empty so \(f = 0\) on \(U\) or has isolated zeros. Thus having isolated zero is a property of a domain, not a local property.

\begin{corollary}
  If \(f\) and \(g\) are analytic on \(U\) then either \(f = g\) on \(U\) or \(f(z) = g(z)\) on a discrete set.
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}
  If \(f\) is analytic on the punctured disk \(D(a, r)^* := D(a, r) \setminus \{a\}\) for some \(r > 0\), then \(f\) has an isolated singularity at \(a\).
\end{definition}

In this case, we obtain the analogue of power series, \emph{Laurent series} at \(a\)
\[
  f(z) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} c_n (z - a)^n.
\]

There are three possibilities:
\begin{enumerate}
\item removable singularity: \(c_n = 0\) for all \(n < 0\).
\item pole: there exists \(N < 0\) such that \(c_N \neq 0\) and \(c_n = 0\) for all \(n < N\). We say \(f\) has a pole of order \(-N\) and can write \(f(z) = (z - a)^N g(z)\) where \(g\) is analytic and nonzero at \(a\).
\item essential singularity: \(c_n \neq 0\) for infinitely many \(n < 0\).
\end{enumerate}

However, characterisation in terms of Laurent series is coordinate-dependent. Intrinsically, recall that

\begin{theorem}
  \(f\) has a removable singularity at \(a\) if and only if \(f\) is bounded on \(D(a, r)^*\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Casorati-Weierstrass]
  \(f\) has an essential singularity at \(a\) if and only if for every punctured disk \(D(a, r)^*\) in the domain of \(f\), the image \(f(D(a, r)^*)\) is dense in \(\C\).
\end{theorem}

For completeness sake, we state that \(f\) has a pole at \(a\) if and only if neither of the above happens (so \(\lim_{z \to a} |f(z)| = \infty\)).

This allows us, for example, to extend the definitions to infinity. Consider the Riemann sphere \(C_\infty\), on which a neighbourhood of infinity is the complement of a closed set not including \(\infty\). Mapping it to the complex plane, we define a puncutre disk around \(\infty\) to be the complement of a closed disk in \(\C\). Then we can talk conveniently about singularity at \(\infty\).

\begin{eg}
  \(f(z) = \frac{1}{e^z - 1}\) is meromorphic on \(\C\) with poles at \(z = 2\pi n i\) where \(n \in \Z\). By considering \(g(z) = \frac{z}{e^z - 1}\) which has removable singularity at \(0\), we know \(f\) has ple of order \(1\) at \(0\), and therefore at all poles by periodicity.

  At \(\infty\), we have an essential singularity : along the imaginary axis, \(|f(z)|\) can be arbitrarily big so it cannot be a removable singularity. Along the positive real axis, \(|f(z)| \to 0\) so it cannot be a pole.
\end{eg}

\begin{definition}[meromorphic function]\index{meromorphic function}
  \(f\) is \emph{meromorphic} on a domain \(U \subseteq \C_\infty\)  if it has only isolated singularies, none of which are essential.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Complex logarithm}

Given nonzero \(z = r e^{i \theta}\), if \(e^w = z\), we know that \(w = \log r + (2\pi n + \theta) i\) for some \(n \in \Z\). We can make a continuous choice of \(\log z\) on, for example, \(U = \C \setminus \R_{\geq 0}\), by choosing \(0 < \theta < 2\pi\) and fixing some \(n \in \Z\). This makes \(f_n(z) := \log r + (2\pi n + \theta)i\) a well-defined continuous analytic function on \(U\).

\begin{note}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If \(g: U \to V\) is an analytic bijection, then any inverse \(h: V \to U\) is analytic.
  \item If \(g: U \to V\) is analytic, then any \emph{continuous} inverse \(h: V \to U\) is analytic.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{note}

More naturally,

\begin{proposition}
  Fix \(n \in \Z\) and define \(h(z) := \int_{-1}^z \frac{dw}{w} + (2n + 1)\pi i\) for \(z \in U\), where the integral is taken over the straight line from \(-1\) to \(z\), then \(h\) is analytic on \(U\) and inverse to \(z \mapsto e^z\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  First show \(h\) is analytic with \(f'(z) = \frac{1}{z}\).
  \[
    \frac{h(z + \tau) - h(z)}{\tau}
    = \frac{1}{\tau} \int_z^{z + \tau} \frac{dw}{w}
  \]
  for \(\tau\) sufficiently small (such that the triangle formed by \(-1\), \(z\) and \(z + \tau\) lies in \(U\)) by Cauchy's Theorem. Then
  \[
    \left| \frac{1}{\tau} \int_z^{z + \tau} \frac{dw}{w} - \frac{1}{z} \right|
    = \left| \frac{1}{\tau} \int_z^{z + \tau} \frac{z - w}{zw} dw \right|
    \to 0
  \]
  as \(\tau \to 0\).

  Now define \(g(z) = \frac{e^{h(z)}}{z}\) so \(g'(z) = \frac{z e^{h(z)} h'(z) - e^{h(z)}}{z}\) and so \(g'(z) = 0\) identically. \(g(-1) = 1\) so \(e^{h(z)} = z\) for all \(z \in U\).

\end{proof}
