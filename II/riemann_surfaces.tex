\section{Complex analysis \& Branching/Multivalued functions}

\subsection{Holomorphicity}

\begin{definition}
  A smooth function \(f: U \to \C\) from a domain (i.e.\ an open connected subset of \(\C\)) is \emph{holomorphic} or \emph{analytic} if either of the following holds:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(f\) is differentiable in the sense of limits (which is equivalent to satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann equations),
  \item for each \(a \in U\), \(f\) has a power series expansion
    \[
      f(z) = \sum_{n \geq 0} a_n (z - a)^n,
    \]
    valid on some disk \(D(a, r)\) with positive radius \(r > 0\).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  1 implies 2 since \(f\) being differentiable allows us to construct \(a_n\) using Cauchy Integral Formula. 2 implies 1 since \(f\) having power series allows term-by-term differentiation.
\end{remark}

By 2, if \(a \in U\) and \(f\) is not identically \(0\) near \(a\), then there exists some minimal \(m \geq 0\) such that \(a_m \neq 0\). It follows that \(f(z) = a_m (z - a)^m (1 + g(z - a))\) where \(\lim_{z \to a} g(z - a) = 0\). Therefore for \(z\) sufficiently close to \(a\), \(f\) is nonzero. This is known as

\begin{theorem}[Principle of isolated zeros]
  An analytic function on a domain \(U\) which is not identically zero has isolated zeros, i.e.\ around each \(a \in U\), there exists a disk \(\Delta_a\) on which \(f(z) \neq 0\) unless possibly at \(z = a\).
\end{theorem}

If \(f\) is identically \(0\) near \(a\), then there exists a disk \(\Delta_a\) on which \(f(z) = 0\) for all \(z \in \Delta_a\). Consider \(V := \bigcup_{a: f|_{\Delta_a} = 0} \Delta_a\) and \(W := \bigcup_{a: f \neq 0 \text{ near } a} \Delta_a\). \(V\) and \(W\) are open and disjoint so by connectivity of \(U\), one of them is empty so \(f = 0\) on \(U\) or has isolated zeros. Thus having isolated zero is a property of a domain, not a local property.

\begin{corollary}
  If \(f\) and \(g\) are analytic on \(U\) then either \(f = g\) on \(U\) or \(f(z) = g(z)\) on a discrete set.
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}
  If \(f\) is analytic on the punctured disk \(D(a, r)^* := D(a, r) \setminus \{a\}\) for some \(r > 0\), then \(f\) has an isolated singularity at \(a\).
\end{definition}

In this case, we obtain the analogue of power series, \emph{Laurent series} at \(a\)
\[
  f(z) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty} c_n (z - a)^n.
\]

There are three possibilities:
\begin{enumerate}
\item removable singularity: \(c_n = 0\) for all \(n < 0\).
\item pole: there exists \(N < 0\) such that \(c_N \neq 0\) and \(c_n = 0\) for all \(n < N\). We say \(f\) has a pole of order \(-N\) and can write \(f(z) = (z - a)^N g(z)\) where \(g\) is analytic and nonzero at \(a\).
\item essential singularity: \(c_n \neq 0\) for infinitely many \(n < 0\).
\end{enumerate}

However, characterisation in terms of Laurent series is coordinate-dependent. Intrinsically, recall that

\begin{theorem}
  \(f\) has a removable singularity at \(a\) if and only if \(f\) is bounded on \(D(a, r)^*\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Casorati-Weierstrass]
  \(f\) has an essential singularity at \(a\) if and only if for every punctured disk \(D(a, r)^*\) in the domain of \(f\), the image \(f(D(a, r)^*)\) is dense in \(\C\).
\end{theorem}

For completeness sake, we state that \(f\) has a pole at \(a\) if and only if neither of the above happens (so \(\lim_{z \to a} |f(z)| = \infty\)).

This allows us, for example, to extend the definitions to infinity. Consider the Riemann sphere \(C_\infty\), on which a neighbourhood of infinity is the complement of a closed set not including \(\infty\). Mapping it to the complex plane, we define a puncutre disk around \(\infty\) to be the complement of a closed disk in \(\C\). Then we can talk conveniently about singularity at \(\infty\).

\begin{eg}
  \(f(z) = \frac{1}{e^z - 1}\) is meromorphic on \(\C\) with poles at \(z = 2\pi n i\) where \(n \in \Z\). By considering \(g(z) = \frac{z}{e^z - 1}\) which has removable singularity at \(0\), we know \(f\) has ple of order \(1\) at \(0\), and therefore at all poles by periodicity.

  At \(\infty\), we have an essential singularity : along the imaginary axis, \(|f(z)|\) can be arbitrarily big so it cannot be a removable singularity. Along the positive real axis, \(|f(z)| \to 0\) so it cannot be a pole.
\end{eg}

\begin{definition}[meromorphic function]\index{meromorphic function}
  \(f\) is \emph{meromorphic} on a domain \(U \subseteq \C_\infty\)  if it has only isolated singularies, none of which are essential.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Complex logarithm}

Given nonzero \(z = r e^{i \theta}\), if \(e^w = z\), we know that \(w = \log r + (2\pi n + \theta) i\) for some \(n \in \Z\). We can make a continuous choice of \(\log z\) on, for example, \(U = \C \setminus \R_{\geq 0}\), by choosing \(0 < \theta < 2\pi\) and fixing some \(n \in \Z\). This makes \(f_n(z) := \log r + (2\pi n + \theta)i\) a well-defined continuous analytic function on \(U\).

\begin{note}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If \(g: U \to V\) is an analytic bijection, then any inverse \(h: V \to U\) is analytic.
  \item If \(g: U \to V\) is analytic, then any \emph{continuous} inverse \(h: V \to U\) is analytic.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{note}

More naturally,

\begin{proposition}
  Fix \(n \in \Z\) and define \(h(z) := \int_{-1}^z \frac{dw}{w} + (2n + 1)\pi i\) for \(z \in U\), where the integral is taken over the straight line from \(-1\) to \(z\), then \(h\) is analytic on \(U\) and inverse to \(z \mapsto e^z\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  First show \(h\) is analytic with \(f'(z) = \frac{1}{z}\).
  \[
    \frac{h(z + \tau) - h(z)}{\tau}
    = \frac{1}{\tau} \int_z^{z + \tau} \frac{dw}{w}
  \]
  for \(\tau\) sufficiently small (such that the triangle formed by \(-1\), \(z\) and \(z + \tau\) lies in \(U\)) by Cauchy's Theorem. Then
  \[
    \left| \frac{1}{\tau} \int_z^{z + \tau} \frac{dw}{w} - \frac{1}{z} \right|
    = \left| \frac{1}{\tau} \int_z^{z + \tau} \frac{z - w}{zw} dw \right|
    \to 0
  \]
  as \(\tau \to 0\).

  Now define \(g(z) = \frac{e^{h(z)}}{z}\) so \(g'(z) = \frac{z e^{h(z)} h'(z) - e^{h(z)}}{z}\) and so \(g'(z) = 0\) identically. \(g(-1) = 1\) so \(e^{h(z)} = z\) for all \(z \in U\).

\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[direct analytic continuation]\index{analytic continuation!direct}
  A \emph{function element} in a domain \(U\) is a pair \((f, D)\) where \(D\) is a subdomain of \(U\) and \(f\) is an analytic function on \(D\). Two function elements \((f, D)\) and \((g, E)\) are equivalent, write \((f, D) \sim (g, E)\) if \(D \cap E \neq \emptyset\) and \(f = g\) on \(D \cap E\).

  We say \((g, E)\) is a \emph{direct analytic continuation} of \((f, D)\).
\end{definition}

Why do we make such a definition? We know the power series
\[
  \sum_{r \geq 0} z^k = \frac{1}{1 - z}
\]
is defined on \(D(0, 1)\) and cannot be extended to any larger domain due to natural boundary. However, \(\frac{1}{1 - z}\) is homomorphic  on \(\C \setminus \{1\}\) so sometimes the domain forced by definition of a function is not the maximal possible. In other words, sometimes we are looking at the ``correct'' function with a ``wrong'' domain.

\begin{definition}[analytic continuation along path]\index{analytic continuation!along path}
  We say \((g, E)\) is an \emph{analytic continuation of \((f, D)\) along \(\gamma\)} if \(\gamma: [0, 1] \to U\) and there exist function elements \((f_i, D_i)\), \(i \in \{0, \dots, n\}\) and \(0 = t_0 < t_2 < \dots < t_n = 1\) such that
  \[
    (f, D) = (f_0, D_0) \sim (f_1, D_1) \sim \dots \sim (f_{n - 1}, D_{n - 1}) \sim (f_n, D_n) = (g, E)
  \]
  and \(\gamma([t_j, t_{j + 1}]) \subseteq D_j\) for \(j \in \{0, \dots, n - 1\}\).

  Write \((f, D) \approx_\gamma (g, E)\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  As \(\C\) has a path-connected basis for the topology, domains are path-connected.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[analytic continuation]\index{analytic continuation}
  We say \((g, E)\) is an \emph{analytic continuation} of \((f, D)\) if there exists a path \(\gamma\) such that \((f, D) \approx_\gamma (g, E)\). In this case we write \((f, D) \approx (g, E)\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If \((f, D) \approx_\gamma (g, E)\) and \((f, D) \approx_\gamma (h, E)\) then \(g = h\) by repeated application of the identity principle. In other words, \(g\) is completely determined by \(f\) and \(\gamma\).
  \item Analytic continuation is an equivalence relation (exercise), but direct analytic continuation is \emph{not} transitive, even if the pairwise intersections of the domains are nonempty. If fact, that is the whole point of analytic continuation along path.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[complete analytic function]\index{complete analytic function}
  An equivalence class of function elements under \(\approx\) is a \emph{complete analytic function}.
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}[complex logarithm]
  Let \(U = \C\) be the ambient space. Given \(\alpha < \beta\) in \(\R\), define
  \[
    E_{(\alpha, \beta)} := \{z = r^{i \theta}: r > 0, \alpha < \theta < \beta\}.
  \]
  Note \(\C \setminus \R_{\geq 0} = E_{(0, 2\pi)}\). If \(\beta - \alpha \leq 2\pi\), define
  \[
    f_{(\alpha, \beta)}(z) = \log r + i\theta
  \]
  where \(z = re^{i\theta}, \alpha < \theta < \beta\). Then \((f_{(\alpha, \beta)}, E_{(\alpha, \beta)})\) is a function element for any such \(\alpha, \beta\).

  Let
  \begin{align*}
    A &= (-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}) \\
    B &= (\frac{\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}) \\
    C &= (\frac{5\pi}{6}, \frac{11\pi}{6})
  \end{align*}
  and \(\gamma: [0, 1] \to U, t \mapsto e^{2\pi i t}\) and choose
  \[
    0 = t_0 < t_1 = \frac{1}{6} < t_2 = \frac{1}{2} < t_3 = \frac{5}{6} < t_4 = 1
  \]
  and \((f_A, E_A), (f_B, E_B), (f_C, E_C)\) the corresponding function elements.

  When the \emph{intervals} overlap, the function elements agree so
  \[
    (f_A, E_A) \sim (f_B, E_B) \sim (f_C, E_C),
  \]
  but
  \[
    f_C(z) = f_A(z) + 2\pi i, z \in E_A \cap E_C
  \]
  which shows nontransitivity of \(\sim\). In fact, \(f_A + 2\pi i \sim f_C\). However we see \((f_A, E_A) \approx_\gamma (f_C, E_C)\) and so \((f_A, E_A) \approx (f_C, E_C)\). By repeating the process with intervals moving to infinity to \(\R\), we see that all the \(\log r + (2\pi n + \theta) i\) are in the same class for \(\approx\). On the other hand, if \((f, D) \approx_\gamma (f_{A'}, E_{A'})\) for some interval \(A'\) then applying identity principle along the path to \(e^{f_i}\) shows that \(f\) is one of the branches of \(\log\).

  Now we can define a space that contains all branches of logarithm. On \(U = \C \setminus \R_{\geq 0}\), define
  \[
    f_n(z) = \log n + (2\pi n + \theta)i
  \]
  where \(0 < \theta < 2\pi\). Then \((f_n, U)\) are function elements in the complete analytic function of \(\log\), and ``almost'' all of them. Take \(\Z\) copies of \(U\) and we can glue them along \(\R_{\geq 0}\). More precisely, for any \(n \in \Z\) and \(\alpha > 0\), there exists a neighbourhood \(V\) of \(\alpha\) and a function element \((g, V)\) such that
  \[
    (f_{n + 1}, E_{(0, \varepsilon)}) \sim (g, V) \sim (f_n, E_{(2\pi - \varepsilon, 2\pi)})
  \]
  for some \(\varepsilon > 0\).

  This object is the ``gluing construction'' of the Riemann surface associated to \(\log\). Since these \((g, V)\) exist, the resulting surface \(R\) will admit a \emph{continuous} function \(f\) such that the following diagram commutes:
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      R \ar[r, "f"] \ar[d, "\pi"] & \C \ar[dl, "\exp"] \\
      \C^*
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]

  The rigorous construction is as follow. Let \(R = \coprod _{k \in \Z} \C^*\) and a basis for the topology on \(R\) is
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item disks contained in a single sheet: \(D((\eta, k), r)\) disk of radius \(r\) about \(\eta \in \C \setminus \R_{\geq 0}\) at level \(k\), where \(r\) is sufficently small such that the disk does not interset \(\R_{\geq 0}\),
  \item disks along \(\R_{\geq 0}\): for \(\eta > 0, k \in \Z, r < |\eta|\),
    \[
      A((\eta, k), r) = \{(z, k): |z - \eta| < r, \Im z \geq 0\} \amalg \{(z, k - 1), |z - \eta| < r, \Im z < 0\}.
    \]
  \end{enumerate}

Check that this makes \(R\) into a Hausdorff, path-connected space. \(R\) comes with a natural projection \(\pi: R \to \C^*, (\eta, k) \mapsto \eta\). This is a continuous map as the preimage of a small disk \(D(\eta, r) \subseteq \C^*\) is countably many copies of that disk, one for each sheet. This is precisely the definition of a covering space.
\end{eg}

\begin{definition}[covering space]\index{covering space}
  A \emph{covering space} of a topological space \(X\) is a continuous map \(p: \tilde X \to X\) where \(\tilde X\) and \(X\) are Hausdorff and path-connected and \(p\) is a local homeomorphism, i.e.\ for each \(\tilde x \in \tilde X\), there exists a neighbourhood \(\tilde N\) of \(\tilde x\) such that \(p|_{\tilde N}\) is a homeomorphism.

    \(X\) is the \emph{base space} of \(p\).

    The cover is \emph{regular} if for all \(x \in X\), there exists a neighbourhood of \(x\) such that \(p^{-1}(N)\) is a disjoint union of sets mapped homeomorphically by \(p\) to \(N\).
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
  Whether including regularity in the definition of covering space is a matter of taste. It is ususally included in algebraic topology, e.g.\ in IID Algebraic Topology.
\end{note}

\begin{remark}
  \(\pi: R \to \C^*\) is a regular cover.
\end{remark}

\begin{eg}[a non-regular cover]
  Consider \(p: \tilde X \to \C^*, z \mapsto e^z\) where
  \[
    \tilde X = \{z \in \C: 0 < \Im z < 4\pi\}.
  \]
  It is a covering space but consider \(1 \in \C^*\). Any preimage of a sufficiently small disk centred at \(1\) will be the disjoint union of one disk at \(2\pi i\) and two half disks at \(0\) and \(4\pi i\) each. Thus \(p\) fails to be a regular cover as we choose the ``wrong'' domain.
\end{eg}

Define
\begin{align*}
  f: R &\to \C \\
  (\eta, k) &\mapsto \log r + (2\pi k + \theta) i
\end{align*}
where \(\eta = re^{i\theta}, 0 \leq \theta < 2\pi\). Then \(f\) is a continuous bijection and the following diagram commutes:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    R \ar[r, "f"] \ar[d, "\pi"] & \C \ar[dl, "\exp"] \\
    \C^*
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

A similar construction can be done for the multivalued function \(z^{1/n}\) where \(n \in \N\). As a multivalued function,
\[
  (e^{i\theta})^{1/n} = r^{1/n} e^{i\theta/n} e^{2\pi ki/n}
\]
for \(k \in \Z/n\Z\). Define \(R_n = \coprod_{k \in \Z/n\Z} \C^*\) but gluing near modulo \(n\) (``top sheet to bottom sheet''). Then we have \(f_n, \pi_n\) such that the following diagram commutes:
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    R_n \ar[r, "f_n"] \ar[d, "\pi_n"] & \C^* \ar[dl, "z \mapsto z^n"] \\
    \C^*
  \end{tikzcd}
\]

\begin{definition}[regular/singular point]\index{regular point}
  Let \(f(z) = \sum_{k \geq 0} a_k z^k\) with radius of convergence \(1\). A point \(z \in \p D(0, 1)\) is \emph{regular} if there exists a neighbourhood \(N\) of \(z\) and a holomorphic \(g\) on \(N\) such that \(g = f\) on \(N \cap D(0, 1)\), i.e.\ \(g\) is a regular analytic continuation of \(f\).

  If \(z \in \p D(0, 1)\) is not regular it is \emph{singular}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The regular points of \(\p D(0, 1)\) form an open set in the subspace topology on \(\p D(0, 1)\).
  \item \(z\) is regular does \emph{not} mean that the series converges at \(z\). Consider the classical example \(f(z) = \sum_{k \geq 0} z^k\), which is regular everywhere except \(z = 1\) (\(g(z) = \frac{1}{1 - z}\)).
  \item The converse does not hold either. A series converges at \(z\) does not imply that it is regular there. For example, \(g(z) = \sum_{k \geq 2} \frac{z^k}{(k - 1)k}\) converges at all \(z \in \p D(0, 1)\). If it was regular at such a point then the second derivative \(g''(z) = \sum_{k \geq 0} z^k\) would also be regular at \(z\). But \(g''(z) \to \infty\) as \(z \to 1\) so \(f\) cannot agree on a neighbourhood of \(1\) with any holomorphic function.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

However, regularity does affect radius of convergence:
\begin{proposition}
  Suppose \(f(z) = \sum_{k \geq 0} a_kz^k\) with radius of convergence \(1\). Then there exists a singular point on \(\p D(0, 1)\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose not so for each \(z \in \p D(0, 1)\) there exists a neighbourhood \(N_z\) of \(z\) and \(g_z\) on \(N_z\) holomorphic with \(g_z = f\) on \(N_z \cap D(0, 1)\). These extensions can be glued together by identity principle. As \(\p D(0, 1)\) is compact, there exists a finite collection of \(z_1, \dots, z_m \in \p D(0, 1)\) such that \(N_{z_i}\)'s cover \(\p D(0, 1)\). wlog let the neighbourhoods be disks. Then we can choose \(\delta > 0\) sufficiently small such that \(f\) is holomorphic on \(D(0, 1 + \delta)\). Contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[natural boundary]\index{natural boundary}
  The disk boundary \(\p D(0, 1)\) is the \emph{natural boundary} for \(f\) if all points on the boundary are singular.
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
  \(f(z) = \sum_{k \geq 0} z^{k!}\) has natural boundary \(\p D(0, 1)\). Consider \(\omega = e^{2\pi i \frac{p}{q}}\) a root of unity. For \(0 < r < 1\),
  \[
    f(r \omega)
    = \sum_{k \geq 0} r^{k!} \omega^{k!}
    = \sum_{k \leq q - 1} r^{k!} \omega^{k!} + \sum_{k \geq q} r^{k!}
  \]
  so as \(r \to 1\) the last term goes to infinity so this cannot agree with a holomorphic function on a neighbourhood of \(\omega\). Since the closure of roots of unity is \(\p D(0, 1)\), every point is singular.
\end{eg}

\begin{definition}[Riemann surface]\index{Riemann surface}
  A \emph{Riemann surface} \(R\) is a connected, Hausdorff topological space, together with a collection of homeomorphisms \(\phi_\alpha: U_\alpha \to D_\alpha \subseteq \C\) with \(U_\alpha\) open, so that
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(\bigcup_{\alpha} U_\alpha = R\),
  \item if \(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \neq \emptyset\) then \(\phi_\beta \compose \phi_\alpha^{-1}\) is analytic on \(\phi_\alpha(U_\alpha \cap U_\beta)\).
  \end{enumerate}

  For a given \(\alpha\), \((U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha)\) is a \emph{chart}, and these compositions \(\phi_\beta \compose \phi_\alpha^{-1}\) are \emph{transition functions}. The collection of charts is known as an \emph{atlas} on \(R\).
\end{definition}

In other words, a Riemann surface is precisely a one-dimensional complex manifold.

\begin{definition}[analytic function between Riemann surfaces]\index{analytic}
  Let \(R, S\) be Riemann surfaces with atlases \(\{(U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha)\}\) and \(\{(V_\beta, \psi_\beta)\}\) respectively. A continuous map \(f: R \to S\) is \emph{analytic} or \emph{holomorphic} if whenever \(U_\alpha \cap f^{-1}(V_\beta) \neq \emptyset\), then
  \[
    \psi_\beta \compose f \compose \phi_\alpha^{-1}
  \]
  on \(\phi_\alpha(U_\alpha \cap f^{-1}(V_\beta))\) is analytic.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  Analyticity is local. An equivalent definition is to say \(f\) is analytic at \(x \in R\) if whenever \(x \in U_\alpha \cap f^{-1}(V_\beta)\) then \(\psi_\beta \compose f \compose \phi_\alpha^{-1}\) is analytic on a neighbourhood of \(\phi_\alpha(x)\).
\end{remark}

\begin{eg}
  \((\C, z)\) is a Riemann surface with one chart where we denote by \(z\) the map \(z \mapsto z\), as is \((\C, z + 1)\) and \((\C, \conj z)\).
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  The Möbius band cannot be made into a Riemann surface because it is non-orientable. Informally, if we put an atlas on the Möbius band, we could choose it so that the centre circle maps to a space homeomorphic to a circle. And as analytic transition implies conformity, consistent choice of ``inside'' of the circle leads to a consistent choice on ``inside'' on the Möbius band, which is a contradiction.
\end{eg}

\begin{remark}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Each transition function has continuous inverses and so are conformal equivalence on their domains.
  \item \(R\) is connected with a path-connected basis so \(R\) is path-connected.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[equivalent atlas]\index{atlas!equivalent}
  Two atlases \(\{(U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha\}\) and \(\{(V_\beta, \psi_\beta)\}\) are \emph{equivalent} if their union is also an atlas, i.e.\ whenever \(U_\alpha \cap V_\beta \neq \emptyset\) then \(\psi_\beta \compose \phi_\alpha^{-1}\) on \(\phi(U_\alpha \cap V_\beta)\) is analytic.
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
  \((\C, z)\) and \((\C, z + 1)\) are equivalent: \(z \mapsto z + 1\) (or \(z \mapsto z - 1\)) are analytic. On the other had \((\C, z)\) and \((\C, \conj z)\) are not equivalent as \(z \mapsto \conj z\) is not analytic.
\end{eg}

We will see later that the notion of equivalence defines an equivalence relation on the collection of atlases on a fixed \(R\).

\begin{definition}[conformal structure]\index{conformal structure}
  An equivalence class of atlases on \(R\) is a \emph{conformal structure} on \(R\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If \(R\) is a Riemann surface and \(S \subseteq R\) is open and connected then restriction of the chart maps provides a conformal structure on \(S\), for which \(i: S \embed R\) is analytic.
  \item Two atlases are equivalent if and only if the identity map is analytic.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{proposition}
  Let \(f: R \to S, g: S \to T\) be analytic maps of Riemann surfaces. Then \(g \compose f\) is analytic.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose \(\{(U_\alpha, \phi_\alpha)\}, \{(V_\beta, \psi_\beta)\}\) and \(\{(W_\gamma, \theta_\gamma)\}\) are atlases on \(R, S\) and \(T\) respectively. Let \(h = g \compose f\) which is continuous. Suffices to show that whenever
  \[
    Y := U_\alpha f^{-1}(V_\beta) \cap h^{-1} (W_\gamma)
  \]
  is nonempty then
  \[
    \theta_\gamma \compose g \compose f \compose \phi_\alpha^{-1}

  is analytic on \(Y\). Since \(\psi_\beta \compose f \compose \phi_\alpha^{-1}\) is analytic on \(\phi_\alpha(Y)\) and \(\theta_\gamma \compose g \compose \psi_\beta^{-1}\) is analytic on \(\psi_\beta \compose f (Y)\), we concluded that
  \[
    \theta_\gamma \compose g \compose \psi_\beta^{-1} \compose \psi_\beta \compose f \compose \phi_\alpha^{-1}

\begin{corollary}
  Equivalence of atlas is an equivalence relation.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}
  Suppose \(R\) is a Riemann surface and \(\pi: \tilde R \to R\) is a covering map. Then there is a unique conformal structure on \(\tilde R\) which makes \(\pi\) analytic.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  
\end{proof}

\begin{eg}
  Let \(R = \coprod_{k \in \Z} \C^*\) and \(\pi: R \to \C^*, (\eta, k) \mapsto \eta\) be a covering map. Then there exists a unique conformal structure on \(R\) for which \(\pi\) is analytic. Note that the following diagram commutes, \(f\) is a continuous map and locally \(f\) is the composition of inverse of \(\exp\) and projection so \(f\) is analytic.

      R \ar[r, "f"] \ar[d, "\pi"] & \C \ar[dl, "\exp"] \\
      \C^*
    \end{tikzcd}
