\section{Smooth Manifolds}

\begin{definition}[Smooth]\index{smooth}
  Let \(U \subseteq \R^n\) be an open set and \(f: U \to \R^m\). \(f\) is said to be \emph{smooth} if
  \[
    \frac{\p^{|\alpha|} f}{\p x^\alpha}
  \]
  exists for all multi-indices \(\alpha\).
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}
  A multi-index \(\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n)\) is a tuple of non-negative integers and \(|\alpha| = \sum_{i = 1}^n \alpha_i\).
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}[Smooth]\index{smooth}
  Let \(X \subseteq \R^n\) be a subset. \(f: X \to \R^m\) is \emph{smooth} if for all \(x \in X\), there exists \(U \subseteq \R^n\), \(x \in U\) such that there exists smooth \(\tilde f: U \to \R^m\) extending \(f|_{X \cap U}\). i.e.\ the following diagram commutes
  \[
    \begin{tikzcd}
      U \ar[r, "\tilde f"] & \R^m \\
      U \cap X \ar[u, "\iota"] \ar[ur, "f"']
    \end{tikzcd}
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item This is a local property.
    \item \(X\) is a topological space with subspace topology induced from \(\R^n\). \(f\) is smooth implies that \(f\) is continuous.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Diffeomorphism]\index{diffeomorphism}
  Let \(X \subseteq \R^n\) and \(Y \subseteq \R^m\). A map \(f: X \to Y\) is a \emph{diffeomorphism} if \(f\) is smooth and bijective and its inverse \(f^{-1}: Y \to X\) is also smooth.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Diffeomorphism implies homeomorphism (with repsect to the subspace topology).
  \item Diffeomorphism is an equivalence relation.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Manifold]\index{manifold}
  A \emph{\(k\)-dimensional manifold} is a set \(X \subseteq \R^N\) such that for all \(x \in X\) there exists \(V \subseteq X\) open, \(x \in V\) such that \(V\) is diffeomorphic to an open subset \(U \subseteq \R^k\), i.e.\ \(X\) is locally diffeomorphic to \(\R^k\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  The diffeomorphism \(\varphi: U \to V\) is called a \emph{local parameterisation} and its inverse \(\varphi^{-1}: V \to U\) is called \emph{coordinate charts}. More specifically, let \(x_i: \R^k \to \R\) be the projection of the \(i\)th coordinate and we have \emph{local coordinate} \(x_i \compose \varphi^{-1}: V \to \R\). However, sometimes we abuse the notation and just write \(x_i: V \to \R\) for the above map.
\end{remark}

\begin{notation}
  Write \(\dim X = k\) if \(X\) is a \(k\)-dimensional manifold.
\end{notation}

\begin{eg}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(\R^N\) is an \(N\)-dim manifold. For example, \(\varphi: \R^N \stackrel{\id}{\to} \R^N\).
  \item An open subset \(V \subseteq \R^N\) is an \(N\)-dim manifold, for example by taking \(\varphi\) to be the restriction \(\id|_V\).
  \item In general, if \(X\) is a manifold and \(V \subseteq X\) is an open subset then \(V\) is also a manifold.
  \item The \(n\)-sphere, \(S^n \subseteq \R^{n + 1} = \{x_1^2 + \dots + x_{n + 1}^2 = 1\}\) is an \(n\)-dim manifold. Suppose \(x \in S^n\) lies in the upper half hyperplane define by \(x_{n + 1} > 0\). Take
    \[
      V = S^n \cap \{x_{n + 1} > 0\},\, U = \{(x_1, \dots, x_n): \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 < 1\} = B(\V 0, 1) \subseteq \R^n
    \]
    and define
    \begin{align*}
      \varphi: U &\to V \\
      (x_1, \dots, x_n) &\mapsto \left(x_1, \dots, x_n, +\sqrt{1 - (x_1^2 + \dots + x_n^2)}\right)
    \end{align*}
    Let's do a reality check: the map consists of algebraic operations so is smooth. It is easy to check that the image lies in \(V\). Its inverese is the projection onto the first \(n\) coordinates, which is the restriction of a smooth function so also smooth.

    Similarly, if \(x\) lies in \(\{x_{n + 1} < 0\}\), change \(+\) to \(-\) in the last coordinate of \(\varphi\) will do. This accounts for ``most'' points, with the exception of those on the equator. However, there is nothing special about \(x_{n + 1}\) so we may repeat for the other coordinates. As
    \[
      S^n = \bigcup_{i = 1}^{n + 1} \left( (S^n \cap \{x_i > 0\}) \cup (S^n \cap \{x_i < 0\}) \right)
    \]
    (which in English says that at least one coordinate is non-zero), we have covered \(S^n\) so done.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{eg}

\begin{ex}
  Suppose \(X \subseteq \R^n\) and \(Y \subseteq \R^m\) are manifolds. Show that \(X \times Y \subseteq \R^n \times \R^m = \R^{n + m}\) is a manifold of dimension \(\dim X + \dim Y\).
\end{ex}

\begin{definition}[Submanifold]\index{manifold!submanifold}
  Let \(X \subseteq \R^N\) be a manifold. A manifold \(Y \subseteq \R^N\) such that \(Y \subseteq X\) is a \emph{submanifold} of \(X\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  By definition, all manifolds are submanifolds of \(\R^N\) for some \(N\).
\end{remark}

Note that we have yet shown that the dimension of a manifold is well-defined but we will do so in a while. Assuming so, we define

\begin{definition}[Codimension]\index{codimension}
  The \emph{codimension} of \(Y\) in \(X\) is
  \[
    \codim_X(Y) = \dim X - \dim Y.
  \]
\end{definition}

\subsection{Tangent space}

\begin{definition}[Differential]\index{differential}
  Let \(U \subseteq \R^n\) and \(f: U \to \R^m\) be a smooth map. The \emph{differential} of \(f\) at \(x \in U\), \(df_x\) is a linear map
  \begin{align*}
    df_x: \R^n &\to \R^m \\
    h &\mapsto \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{f(x + th) - f(x)}{t}
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

Explicitly, \(df_x\) is represented by the matrix
\[
  \left( \frac{\p f}{\p x_j} \right) \text{ where } f =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    f_1 \\
    \vdots \\
    f_m
  \end{pmatrix}
  .
\]
It then follows that
\[
  df_x(h) = \left(\frac{\p f}{\p x_j}\right)
  \begin{pmatrix}
    h_1 \\
    \vdots \\
    h_n
  \end{pmatrix}
  .
\]

\begin{proposition}[Chain rule]
  Let \(f: U \to V, g: V \to \R^p\) be smooth maps where \(U \subseteq \R^n, V \subseteq \R^m\). Let \(x \in U\) and \(f(x) \in V\). Then
  \[
    d(g \compose f)_x = dg_{f(x)} \compose df_x.
  \]
\end{proposition}

The aim of this section is to define differentials of maps between manifolds. Before that we have to find where differential lives. Certainly in \(\R^n\) it is a linear map living in a linear space.

Let \(X \subseteq \R^N\) be a \(k\)-dim manifold and \(x \in X\). Let \(\varphi\) be a local parameterisation around \(x\). Wlog assume \(\varphi^{-1}(x) = 0\). Note that \(\varphi\) is defined on an open subset of \(\R^k\) so we can do calculus on it (this is false for \(\varphi^{-1}\) as \(V \subseteq \R^N\) may not be open). We can define
\[
  d\varphi_0: \R^k \to \R^N.
\]

\begin{definition}[Tangent space]\index{tangent space}
  The \emph{tangent space} of \(X\) at \(x\), denoted \(T_xX\), is \(d\varphi_0(\R^k)\), a subspace of \(\R^N\).
\end{definition}

For this to be a good definition, we need to show that it is independent of \(\varphi\) and \(\dim d\varphi_0(\R^k) = k\).

Suppose \(\varphi: U \to V\) and \(\tilde \varphi: \tilde U \to \tilde V\) are parameterisations around \(x\), again assumming wlog \(\varphi(0) = x = \tilde \varphi(0)\). By taking intersection we can assume \(V = \tilde V\). Write
\[
  \varphi = \tilde \varphi \compose \underbrace{(\tilde \varphi^{-1} \compose \varphi)}_{U \to \tilde U}.
\]
The term in the parenthesis is a map between open subsets of \(\R^k\) so we can do calculus on it. By chain rule
\[
  d\varphi_0 = d\tilde \varphi_0 \compose d(\tilde \varphi^{-1} \compose \varphi)_0.
\]
Note that \(\varphi^{-1} \compose \tilde \varphi\) is the inverse of \(\tilde \varphi^{-1} \compose \varphi\) so by applying chain rule to \(\id\), we get
\[
  \id = d(\varphi^{-1} \compose \tilde \varphi)_0 \compose d(\tilde \varphi^{-1} \compose \varphi)_0
\]
so both of them are invertible. Thus
\[
  d\varphi_0(\R^k) = d\tilde \varphi_0(\R^k).
\]

Next we want to show \(\dim d\varphi_0(\R^k) = k\). Certainly linear algebra tells us that it is at most \(k\). By definition there exists a smooth \(\psi: W \to \R^k\), where \(W \subseteq \R^N\) is an open subset containing \(x\) such that
\[
  \psi|_{X \cap W} = \varphi^{-1}.
\]
Assume wlog \(V \subseteq X \cap W\). Then
\[
  \id_U = \psi \compose \varphi
\]
so by chain rule
\[
  \id = d\psi_x \compose d\varphi_0.
\]
Thus \(d\varphi_0(\R^k)\) is \(k\)-dimensional.

\begin{remark}
  The functions \(\varphi^{-1} \compose \tilde \varphi\) are called \emph{transition functions} and will appear later in the course.
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary}
  The dimension of a manifold is well-defined.
\end{corollary}

\begin{ex}
  If \(X \subseteq \R^N\) is a manifold and \(Y\) is a submanifold of \(X\) then
  \[
    T_yY \leq T_yX
  \]
  for all \(y \in Y\). In particular \(\codim_X(Y) \geq 0\).
\end{ex}

\begin{eg}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(T_x\R^N = \R^N\).
  \item Let \(X\) be an open subset of \(\R^N\). Then \(T_xX = \R^N\).
  \item Let
    \[
      X = \{(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k, 0, \dots, 0)\} \subseteq \R^N
    \]
    which can be seen as the image of the embedding \(\varphi: \R^k \to \R^N\). This is a \(k\)-dim manifold. This is a linear map so \(d\varphi_x = \varphi\). Thus \(T_xX = X\). In general, this holds if \(\varphi\) is an injective linear map.
  \item Let \(S^n \subseteq \R^{n + 1}\). Given a point \(x \in S^n\) with \(x_{n + 1} > 0\), use the parameterisation
    \begin{align*}
      \varphi: B(\V 0, 1) &\to \R^{n + 1} \\
      (x_1, \dots, x_n) &\mapsto \left(x_1, \dots, x_n, + \sqrt{1 - x_1^2 - \dots - x_n^2}\right)
    \end{align*}
    Then
    \[
      \im d\varphi_{(x_1, \dots, x_n)} = \text{span}\left\{\frac{\p \varphi}{\p x_1}, \dots, \frac{\p \varphi}{\p x_n}\right\}.
    \]
    We have
    \[
      \frac{\p \varphi}{\p x_i} = \left(0, \dots, 1, \dots, 0, -\frac{x_i}{x_{n + 1}}\right)
    \]
    and we can verify that for all \(i\),
    \[
      \frac{\p \varphi}{\p x_i} \cdot (x_1, \dots, x_n, x_{n + 1}) = 0
    \]
    so \(T_xS^n\) is \(\{v: v \cdot x = 0\} \subseteq \R^{n + 1}\).
  \end{enumerate}
