# Tripos

This is an repository for Cambridge Maths tripos lecture notes, taken by a fourth year mathmo.

Inspired by some of my great [predecessors](https://github.com/dalcde/cam-notes), I started to live-LaTeX notes during lectures since Michaelmas, 2017. In addition, there are some other notes or summaries I made while reading. More information about me can me found on my [Cambridge homepage](http://qk206.user.srcf.net).
