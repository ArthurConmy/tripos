# Tripos

This is an repository for Cambridge Maths tripos lecture notes, taken by a second year mathmo.

Inspired by some of my great [predecessors](https://github.com/dalcde/cam-notes), I started to live-LaTeX notes during lectures since Michaelmas, 2017. In addition, there are some other notes or summaries I made while reading. More information about me can me found on my [Cambridge homepage](http://qk206.user.srcf.net).

## Content

### Part IB
Currently, the repository contains the following IB course notes, which are actively maintained:
* Methods
* Linear Algebra
* Analysis II
* Markov Chains

Quantum Mechanics is no longer actively maintained sin Oct 17, 2017 although a summary (in progress) can be found.

The folowing IB course notes are in early development:
* Metric and Topological Spaces
* Optimisation

### Part II
The summary for Principles of Quantum Mechaincs (in progress) is available.

The following are some notes I made while reading Dummit and Foote, 3rd Edition. They roughly form a superset of IID Galois Theory:
* Field Theory
* Galois Theory

And some (very incomplete) sporadic notes:
* Dynamical Systems
* Integrable Systems
* Graph Theory
* Automata and Formal Languages 

## Usage
`header.tex` and `logo.jpg` are put in the root directory and symlinked to all subdirectories. To compile use `lualatex`.
