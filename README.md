# Tripos

This is an repository for Cambridge Maths tripos lecture notes, taken by a second year mathmo.

Inspired by some of my great [predecessors](https://github.com/dalcde/cam-notes), I started to live-LaTeX notes during lectures since Michaelmas, 2017. In addition, there are some other notes or summaries I made while reading. More information about me can me found on my [Cambridge homepage](http://qk206.user.srcf.net).

## Content

Currently, the repository contains the following course notes.

### Part IB

* Active development
 * Complex Analysis
 * Numerical Analysis
 * Geometry
* Completed
  * Groups, Rings and Modules
  * Analysis II
  * Linear Algebra
  * Markov Chains
* Incomplete
  * Complex Methods
  * Methods
  * Quantum Mechanics
* Early development
  * Metric and Topological Spaces
  * Optimisation

### Part II

* Active development
  * Logic and Set Theory
  * Differential Geometry
  * Number Fields
  * Galois Theory
* Very incomplete
  * Dynamical Systems
  * Integrable Systems
  * Graph Theory
  * Automata and Formal Languages 

The following are some notes I made while reading Dummit and Foote, 3rd Edition. They roughly form a superset of IID Galois Theory:
* Field Theory
* Galois Theory

## Usage
`header.tex` and `logo.jpg` are put in the root directory and symlinked to all subdirectories. To compile use `lualatex`.
