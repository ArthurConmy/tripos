\section{Eucldiean Geometry}

Let \((\cdot, \cdot)\) be the standard inner product, a.k.a.\ dot product on the Euclidean space \(\R^n\) where for \(x, y \in \R^n\),
\[
  (x, y) = x \cdot y = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_iy_i.
\]
This induces the Euclidean norm
\[
  \norm x = \sqrt{(x, x)}.
\]
Also define the Euclidean distance function
\[
  d(x, y) = \norm{x - y}
\]
which makes \(\R^n\) a metric space.

\begin{definition}[Isometry]\index{isometry}
  A map \(f: \R^n \to \R^n\) is an \emph{isometry} of \(\R^n\) if
  \[
    \forall P, Q \in \R^n,\, d(f(P), f(Q)) = d(P, Q).
  \]
\end{definition}

Recall that an \(n \times n\) matrix \(A\) is \emph{orthogonal} if
\[
  A^TA = AA^T = I.
\]
For any square matrix \(A\) we have
\[
  (Ax, Ay) = (Ax)^T(Ay) = x^TA^TAy = (x, A^TAy)
\]
so we find that \(A\) is orthogonal if and only if \((Ax, Ay) = (x, y)\) for all \(x, y \in \R^n\).

Another point of view:
\[
  (x, y) = \frac{1}{2}(\norm{x + y}^2 -  \norm x^2 - \norm y^2)
\]
so \(A\) is orthogonal if and only if \(\norm{Ax} = \norm x\) for all \(x \in \R^n\).

An example of isometry: let \(f(x) = Ax + b\) where \(b \in \R^n\), then
\[
  d(f(x), f(y)) = \norm{A(x - y)}.
\]
So \(f\) is an isometry if and only if \(A\) is orthogonal.

Surprisingly, it turns out all isometries have this form:

\begin{theorem}
  Every isometry \(f: \R^n \to \R^n\) is of the form \(f(x) = Ax + b\) for some orthogonal matrix \(A\) and some vector \(b \in \R^n\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Let \(e_1, \dots, e_n \in \R^n\) be the standard basis of \(\R^n\). Let \(b = f(0)\), \(a_i = f(e_i) - b\) for \(i = 1, \dots, n\). We want to show that \(a_i\)'s form an orthonormal basis. Firstly
  \[
    \norm{a_i} = \norm{f(e_i) - f(0)} = d(f(e_i), f(0)) = d(e_i, 0) = \norm{e_i} = 1
  \]
  so they have unit length. For \(i \neq j\),
  \begin{align*}
    (a_i, a_j) &= -\frac{1}{2}(\norm{a_i - a_j}^2 - \norm{a_i}^2 - \norm{a_j}^2) \\
               &= -\frac{1}{2}(\norm{f(e_i) - f(e_j)}^2 - 2 \\
               &= -\frac{1}{2}(\norm{e_i - e_j}^2 - 2) \\
               &= 0
  \end{align*}
  Thus \(a_i\)'s form an orthonormal basis of \(\R^n\) and it follows that the matrix \(A\) with columns \(a_i, \dots, a_n\) is orthogonal.

  Let \(g(x) = Ax + b\) which is an isometry. We have \(g(x) = f(x)\) for \(x = 0, e_1, \dots, e_n\). In addition,
  \[
    g^{-1}(x) = A^{-1}(x - b) = A^T(x - b)
  \]
  is an isometry so the composition \(h = g^{-1} \compose f\) is an isometry fixing \(0, e_1, \dots, e_n\). It then suffices to show \(h = \id\). Consider \(x = \sum_{i = 1}^n x_ie_i \in \R^n\). Let \(y = h(x) = \sum_{i = 1}^n y_ie_i\). Then
\begin{align*}
  d(x, e_i)^2 &= \norm x^2 + 1 - 2x_i \\
  d(x, 0)^2 &= \norm x^2 \\
  d(y, e_i)^2 &= \norm y^2 + 1 - 2y_i \\
  d(y, 0)^2 &= \norm y^2
\end{align*}
Since \(h\) is an isometry, \(h(0) = 0\), \(h(e_i) = e_i\) and \(h(x) = y\), we have \(\norm x = \norm y\) so \(x_i = y_i\) for all \(i\). Thus \(h(x) = x\) for all \(x \in \R^n\).
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  \[
    \Isom(\R^n) = \{\text{all isometries of } \R^n\}
  \]
  is a group by composition. This is also known as the group of rigid motions of \(\R^n\).
\end{remark}

\begin{eg}[Reflections in an affine hyperplane \(H \subset \R^n\)]
  Let
  \[
    H = \{x \in \R^n: u \cdot x = c\}
  \]
  where \(\norm u = 1\) and \(c \in \R\). Observe that \(u\) is perpendicular to \(H\) and so is a normal vector. The reflection in \(H\) is defined to be
  \[
    R_H: x \mapsto x - 2(x \cdot u - c)u.
  \]
  It is an exercise in example sheet to show that this is an isometry. Observe that if \(x \in H\) then \(R_H(x) = x\). If \(a \in H, t \in \R\) then
  \[
    R_H(a + tu) = (a + tu) - 2tu = a - tu.
  \]
  Thus \(R_h\) fixes exactly the points in \(H\).

  Conversely, suppose \(S \in \Isom(\R^n)\) and \(S\) fixes every point in \(H\). Let \(a \in H\) and defind translation by \(a\) as
  \[
    T_a(x) = x + a
  \]
  which is clearly an isometry. Conjugate \(S\) by \(T_a\), we get
  \[
    R = T_{-a}ST_a \in \Isom(\R^n)
  \]
  and \(R\) fixes \(H' = T_{-a}(H)\). We choose to work with \(H'\) since \(0 \in H'\), making it a subspace of \(\R^n\). Explicitly, if \(H = \{x: x\cdot u = c\}\) then \(H' = \{x: x \cdot u = 0\}\). Then for all \(x \in H'\),
  \[
    (Ru, x) = (Ru, Rx) = (u, x) = 0.
  \]
  Thus \(Ru\) is orthogonal to \(H'\), i.e.\ lies in the orthogonal complement of \(H'\) in \(\R^n\). Thus \(Ru = \lambda u\) for some \(\lambda \in R\) such that \(\lambda^2 = 1\). So \(\lambda = \pm 1\).

  Since \(R\) fixes \(0 \in \R^n\), \(R\) is linear by the previous theorem and either \(R = \id\) or \(R\) is given by the matrix
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      -1 & & \\
      & 1 & \\
      & & \ddots \\
      & & & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
  \]
  i.e.\ \(R_{H'}\). If \(R = \id\) then \(S = \id\). If \(R = R_{H'}\) then \(S = T_aR_{H'}T_{-a}\). Check that
  \[
    S: x \mapsto x - a \mapsto (x - a) - 2(x \cdot u - a \cdot u) u \mapsto x - 2(x \cdot u - c)u
  \]
  is a reflection. Thus if \(S \in \Isom(\R^n)\) fixing \(H\) and \(S \neq \id \) then \(R\) is the reflection in \(H\).
