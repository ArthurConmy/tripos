\section{Toric variety}

Roughly speaking, algebraic geometry studies the duality between polynomial equations and varieties. Let \(S = \C[x_1, \dots, x_n]\). Let \(I \subseteq S\) be an ideal generated by \(f_1, \dots, f_s\). We have polynomials of different flavours:

\subparagraph{monomial ideal}

A monomial ideal is an ideal \(I \subseteq S\) generated by monomials. The corresponding vanishing loci \(V(I)\) is a union of coordinate subspaces of \(\C^n\).

\begin{eg}\leavevmode
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(x_1 = 0\) in \(S\), \(x_1x_2 = 0\) in \(\C[x_1, x_2]\) which is the union of two axes in \(\C^2\) so reducible.
  \item \(V(x_1^2)\) is the axis with ``additional structure'' as \((x_1^2)\) is not reduced.
  \end{itemize}
\end{eg}

Monomial ideals are thus the simplest kind of varieties and can be studied in a completely combinatorial way.

\paragraph{trinomial ideals}

A trinomial is a polynomial with at most three nonzero distinct monomial terms. Let \(I \subseteq S\) be an ideal generated by trinomials.

\begin{lemma}
  Any affine variety is the vanishing locus of a trinomial ideal.
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
  To be more precise, \(S/I\) as a ring is isomorphic to \(\C[x_1, \dots, C_N]/\mathfrak a\) where \(\mathfrak a \subseteq \C[x_1, \dots, x_n]\) is generated by trinomials.
\end{remark}

In other words, there is no way to distinguish a trinomial ideal and a variety.

\begin{proof}[Sketch]
  There is a trick to prove the lemma. Let \(I \subseteq S\) be an ideal. Let \(a_1 x^{\alpha_1} + \dots + a_\ell x^{\alpha_\ell} = 0\) be an equation determined by \(I\). For each such equation, introduce \((\ell - 3)\) new variables \(\{z_i\}_{i = 1}^{\ell - 3}\). Replace the equation with
  \begin{align*}
    a_1 x^{\alpha_1} + a_2 x^{\alpha_2} + z_1
    &= -z_1 + z_2 + a_3 x^{\alpha_3} \\
    &= -z_2 + z_3 + a_4 x^{\alpha_4} \\
    &= \cdots \\
    &= -z_{\ell - 3} + a_{\ell - 1} x^{\alpha_{\ell - 1}} + a_\ell x^{\alpha_\ell}
  \end{align*}
  Repeat for other equations.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{binomial ideals}

Let \(I \subseteq \C[x_1, \dots, x_n] = S\) be an ideal generated by binomials. Assume that \(I\) is prime (so \(V(I)\) is irreducible and reduced, therefore integral). Let \(X = V(I)\), say \(\dim X = m\). Then we have
\begin{itemize}
\item \(X\) contains \((\C^*)^m\) as a Zariski dense open subset.
\item The multiplication map \((\C^*)^m \times (\C^*)^m \to (\C^*)^m\) extends to a map \(X \times (\C^*)^m \to X\).
\end{itemize}

\begin{eg}\leavevmode
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(\C^n\) generated by \(I = (0)\). It contains \((\C^*)^n\) as a dense open subset and we have multiplication
    \begin{align*}
      \C^n \times (\C^*)^n &\to \C^n \\
      ((z_1, \dots, z_n), (t_1, \dots, t_n)) &\mapsto (z_1t_1, \dots, z_nt_n)
    \end{align*}
  \item \(V(x_1 - x_2) \subseteq \C^3\) is isomorphic to \(\C^2\). \(C^2\) contains a copy of \((\C^*)^2\), given by \(\{(t, t, t'): t, t' \in \C^*\}\).
  \item \(V(x_1^2 - x_2) \subseteq \C^3\) contains a copy of \((\C^*)^2\), given by \(\{(t, t^2, t'): t, t' \in \C\}\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{eg}

Note that the key fact here is that a monomial is a homomorphism \((\C^*)^n \to \C^*\) so the ideal \(I\) encoded the intersection of translates of kernels of homomorphisms.

\begin{definition}[algebraic torus]\index{algebraic torus}
  An \emph{algebraic torus} (over \(\C\)) of rank \(1\) is the group variety \(\mathbb G_m = \C^*\). A rank \(n\) algebraic torus is \(\mathbb G_m^n = (\C^*)^n\).
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  \(\mathbb G_m^n\) is a group variety as it is the loci \(V(x_1 \cdots x_{n + 1} - 1)\) and the group operations are all morphisms of varieties.
\end{remark}
