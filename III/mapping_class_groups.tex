\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Classification of surfaces}

The subject of this course is surfaces, i.e.\ two-dimensional manifolds. We assume throughout the manifold \(S\) is connected, smooth and oriented. More importantly, we assume it is of \emph{finite type}: \(S = \overline S - \{\text{finite set}\}\) where \(\overline S\) is a compact manifold possibly with boundary, and the finite set is contained in its interior.

\begin{theorem}[classification of surfaces of finite type]
  Every connected orientable surface of finite type is diffeomorphic to some \(S_{g, n, b}\) which is a surface of genus \(g\) with \(n\) punctures and \(b\) boundary components.
\end{theorem}

\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}

It has Euler characteristic \(\chi(S) = 2 - 2g - (n + b)\).

\begin{eg}
  Suppose \(\chi(S) > 0\) then \(g = 0, n + 1 = 0 \text{ or } 1\). Thus \(S\) is either \(S^2\), or \(S^2\) with a puncture which is isomorphic to \(\C\), or \(S^2\) with one boundary component which is isomorphic of \(D^2\), which can be thought as sitting inside \(\C\) as the unit disk.

  Note that we can either think of a puncture as a deleted point, or as a marked point on the surface. These two views are equivalent and we will use whichever that is more convenient.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  Suppose \(\chi(S) = 0\) then either \(g = 1, n + b = 0\) or \(g = 0, n + b = 2\). Thus it is either the torus, the punctured plane \(\C_*\), \(S^1 \times I\) or the punctured disk \(D^2_*\).
\end{eg}

\subsection{Mapping class groups}

The natural group associated to a surface \(S\) is the group of orientation-preserving homeomorphism \(\Homeo^+(S)\). However this is a huge group. It might be easier to consider the maps up to homotopy. Suppose \(\phi_0, \phi_1: S \to S\) are homeomorphisms. We can define an equivalence relation \(\phi_0 \sim \phi_1\) if there exists an isotopy \(\phi_t: S \times I \to S\) from \(\phi_0\) to \(\phi_1\).

Another way to think about this: give \(\Homeo^+(S)\) the compact-open topology. Let \(\Homeo_0(S)\) be the path component of \(1_S\). It is an exercise to show that \(\Homeo_0(S)\) is a normal subgroup of \(\Homeo(S)\).

\begin{definition}[mapping class group]\index{mapping class group}
  The \emph{mapping class group} of \(S\) is
  \[
    \Mod(S) = \Homeo^+(S, \b S)/ \Homeo_0(S, \b S)
  \]
  where \(\Homeo(S, \b S)\) is the subgroup of \(\Homeo(S)\) that fixes \(\b S\) pointwise.
\end{definition}

We might ask if we can replace homeomorphism by diffeomorphism, or we replace isotopy by homotopy. Indeed we have

\begin{theorem}[Baer, Munkres]
  For any smooth surface \(S\) of finite type,
  \[
    \Mod(S) \cong \Diff^+(S, \b S)/ \Diff_0(S, \b S) \cong \Homeo^+(S, \b S)/ \sim
  \]
  where the equivalence relation is homotopy.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Context \& Motivation}

\paragraph{bundles}

Let \(\phi \in \Diff(S)\). We can define \(M_\phi = S \times [0, 1]/ \sim\) where \((x, 1) \sim (\phi(x), 1)\). This is called a \emph{surface bundle} over \(S^1\). Note that \(M_\phi\) only depends on \([\phi] \in \Mod(S)\).

More generally, if \(B\) is a space and \(\rho: \pi_1(B) \to \Mod (S)\) then we get a bundle \(\tilde B \times S\) ... this leads to an \(S\)-bundle over \(B\).

\paragraph{moduli space}

More handwavy motivation. Let \(S = S_g = S_{g, 0, 0}\). It turns out the moduli space \(\mathcal M_g\) of geometric structures on \(S_g\) is the same as the moduli space of complex structures on \(S_g\). Morally (but not actually true), the universal cover \(\tilde{\mathcal M_g}\) is \(\mathcal T_g\), the Teich√ºller space, and \(\pi_1(\mathcal M_g)\) is \(\Mod(S)\), so we have \(\mathcal M_g = \Mod(S_g) \setminus \mathcal T_g\).
