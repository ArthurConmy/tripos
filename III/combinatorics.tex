\section{Set systems}

\begin{definition}[set system]\index{set system}
  Let \(X\) be a set. A \emph{set system} on \(X\) (or \emph{family of subsets}) of \(X\) is a family \(\mathcal A \subseteq \powerset (X)\).
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
  We write \(X^{(r)} = \{A \subseteq X: |A| = r\}\)
\end{eg}

In this course we almost deal exclusively with finite setss so unless otherwise stated, in this course we assume all sets are finite and \(X = [n] = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}\).

For example, \(|X^{(r)}| = \binom{n}{r}\). More concretely, for example,
\[
  [4]^{[2]} = \{12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 34\}
\]
where \(12\) denotes \(\{1, 2\}\) to avoid heavy notation. Therefore \(|[4]^{[2]}| = 6\).

What is the mental picture for power set? Often we make \(\powerset (X)\) into a graph, called \(Q_n\), by joining \(A\) to \(B\) if \(|A \Delta B| = 1\) where \(\Delta\) is the symmetric difference, i.e.\ if \(A = B \cup \{i\}\) for some \(i \notin B\) (or vice verse).

\begin{eg}
  \(Q_3\)
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  General picture for \(Q_n\) where \(n\) is even:

  and when \(n\) is odd:
\end{eg}

If we identify a set \(A \subseteq X\) with a \(\{0, 1\}\) sequence of length \(n\) (e.g.\ \(134 \leftrightarrow 1011000 \cdots 0\)), via \(A \leftrightarrow \mathbf{1}_A \text{ or } \chi_A\). In this way, we can represent \(Q_n\) as a \(n\)-dimensional cube:

For this reason, \(Q_n\) is often called the \emph{hypercube} or \emph{discrete cube} or \emph{\(n\)-cube}. In this way, the study of a set system become the study of a graph.

\subsection{Chains \& Antichains}

\begin{definition}[chain]\index{chain}
  A family \(\mathcal A \subseteq \powerset (X)\) is a \emph{chain} if for all \(A, B \in \mathcal A, A \subseteq B \text{ or } B \subseteq A\).
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
  \(\{12, 125, 123589\}\).
\end{eg}

On the other hand, we have

\begin{definition}[antichain]\index{antichain}
  A family \(\mathcal A \subseteq \powerset (X)\) is an \emph{antichain} if for all \(A, B \in \mathcal A\) with \(A \neq B\), \(A \nsubseteq B\).
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
  \(\{1, 467, 2456\}\).
\end{eg}

A natural question is: how large can a chain be? Obviously we can achieve \(|\mathcal A| = n + 1\). We also cannot exceed \(n + 1\) since a chain must meet each ``level'' \(X^{(r)}\) for \(0 \leq r \leq n\) in at most one place.

A less trivial question is how large an antichain can be. We could achieve \(|\mathcal A| = n\) by enumerating all the singletons. It is maximal since adjoining any nonempty set to the family will result in an inclusion. However, it is not the largest antichain. Indeed, we could take \(\mathcal A = X^{(r)}\) for any \(r\). Thus we can achieve \(|\mathcal A| = \binom{n}{\floor{n/2}}\). Can we beat it?

Why can meet each level at only one place? One way to see this is that each level is an antichain: as we can decompose \(Q_n\) into \(n + 1\) antichains, we cannot have a chain longer than that. Inspired by this, we try to decompose \(Q_n\) into chains.

\begin{theorem}[Sperner's lemma]\index{Sperner's lemma}
  Let \(\mathcal A \subseteq \powerset(X)\) where \(|X| = n\) be an antichain. Then
  \[
    |\mathcal A| \leq \binom{n}{\floor{n/2}}.
  \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Sufficient to partition \(\powerset(X)\) into \(\binom{n}{\floor{n/2}}\) chains. For this sufficient to show:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item for all \(r < \frac{n}{2}\), there exist matchings from \(X^{(r)}\) to \(X^{(r + 1)}\) where a matching is just a set of non-adjacent edges,
  \item for all \(r > \frac{n}{2}\), there exist matchings from \(X^{(r)}\) to \(X^{(r - 1)}\).
  \end{enumerate}
  Then put these matchings together to form chains. Each passes through \(X^{(n/2)}\) so there are \(\binom{n}{\floor{n/2}}\) of them.

  By taking complements, sufficient to prove 1. Consider the subgraph of \(Q_n\) spanned by \(X^{(r)} \cup X^{(r + 1)}\) which is bipartite. For any \(\mathcal B \subseteq X^{(r)}\), let \(\Gamma(\mathcal B)\) be the set of points in \(X^{(r + 1)}\) connected to \(B\). Then we have

  \[
    \# (\mathcal B - \Gamma(\mathcal B) \text{ edges}) = |\mathcal B| (n - r)
  \]
  as each point in \(X^{(r)}\) has degree \(n - r\). Meanwhile
  \[
    \# (\mathcal B - \Gamma(\mathcal B) \text{ edges}) \leq |\Gamma(\mathcal B)| (r + 1)
  \]
  as each point in \(X^{(r + 1)}\) has degree \(r + 1\). Thus
  \[
    |\Gamma(\mathcal B)| \geq |\mathcal B| \frac{n - r}{r + 1} \geq |\mathcal B|
  \]
  as \(r < \frac{n}{2}\). Hence by Hall's theorem there exist matchings.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\leavevmode
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \(\binom{n}{\floor{n/2}}\) is achieveable, e.g.\ \(\mathcal A = X^{(\floor{n/2})}\).
  \item Note that the theorem says nothing about extremal cases --- which antinchain have this size?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

The aim is to show that for \(\mathcal A\) an antichain,
\[
  \sum_{r = 0}^n \frac{\mathcal A \cap X^{(r)}}{\binom{n}{r}} \leq 1.
\]
Note that this trivially implies Sperner's lemma. We will use the same setup but bound the numbers more carefully. To justify the following definition, we will write \(X^{(r)}\) above \(X^{(r - 1)}\).

\begin{definition}
  Let \(\mathcal A \subseteq X^{(r)}\) for some \(1 \leq r \leq n\). The \emph{shadow} or \emph{lower shadow} of \(\mathcal A\) is
  \[
    \shadow A = \shadow^- A = \{A - \{i\}: A \in \mathcal A, i \in A\}.
  \]
  so \(\shadow A \subseteq X^{(r - 1)}\).
\end{definition}

\begin{eg}
  Let \(\mathcal A = \{123, 124, 134, 135\} \subseteq X^{(3)}\). Then
  \[
    \shadow A = \{12, 13, 23, 14, 24, 34, 15, 35\} \subseteq X^{(2)}.
  \]
\end{eg}

\begin{lemma}[Local LYM]\index{local LYM}
  Let \(\mathcal A \subseteq X^{(r)}\) where \(1 \leq r \leq n\). Then
  \[
    \frac{|\shadow A|}{\binom{n}{r - 1}} \geq \frac{|\mathcal A|}{\binom{n}{r}}.
  \]
\end{lemma}

Informally, the fraction of the later occupied increases when we take the shadow.

\begin{proof}
  \[
    \#(\mathcal A - \shadow \mathcal A \text{ edges in } Q_n) = r|\mathcal A|
  \]
  by counting from above and
  \[
    \#(\mathcal A - \shadow \mathcal A \text{ edges in } Q_n) \leq (n - r + 1) |\shadow \mathcal A|
  \]
  counting from below so
  \[
    \frac{|\shadow \mathcal A|}{|\mathcal A|} \geq \frac{r}{n - r + 1}
  \]
  but
  \[
    \frac{\binom{r}{r - 1}}{\binom{n}{r}} = \frac{r}{n - r + 1}.
  \]
\end{proof}

When does equality hold in local LYM? We'll need
\[
  (A - \{i\}) \cup \{j\} \in \mathcal A
\]
for all \(a \in \mathcal A, i \in A, j \notin A\). Hence \(\mathcal A = X^{(r)}\) or \(\emptyset\).

\begin{theorem}[LYM inequality]\index{LYM inequality}
  Let \(\mathcal A \subseteq \powerset(X)\) be an antichain. Then
  \[
    \sum_{r = 0}^n \frac{\mathcal A \cap X^{(r)}}{\binom{n}{r}} \leq 1.
  \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The whole idea of the proof can be summarised by ``bubble down with local LYM''. Let \(\mathcal A_r = \mathcal A \cap X^{(r)}\). Obviously
  \[
    \frac{|\mathcal A_n|}{\binom{n}{n}} \leq 1.
  \]
  Also \(\shadow \mathcal A_n\) and \(\mathcal A_{n - 1}\) are distinct as \(\mathcal A\) is an antichain. Thus
  \[
    \frac{|\shadow \mathcal A_n|}{\binom{n}{n - 1}} + \frac{|\mathcal A_{n - 1}|}{\binom{n}{n - 1}}
    = \frac{|\shadow \mathcal A_n \cup \mathcal A_{n - 1}|}{\binom{n}{n - 1}} \leq 1
  \]
  so
  \[
    \frac{|\mathcal A_n|}{\binom{n}{n}} + \frac{|\mathcal A_{n - 1}|}{\binom{n}{n - 1}} \leq 1
  \]
  by local LYM.

  Also \(\shadow (\shadow \mathcal A_n \cup \mathcal A_{n - 1})\) is distint from \(\mathcal A_{n - 2}\), again since \(\mathcal A\) is an antichain. Thus
  \[
    \frac{|\shadow (\shadow \mathcal A_n \cup \mathcal A_{n -1})|}{\binom{n}{n - 2}} +\frac{|\mathcal A_{n - 2}|}{\binom{n}{n - 2}} \leq 1,
  \]
  so
  \[
    \frac{|\shadow \mathcal A_n \cup \mathcal A_{n - 1}|}{\binom{n}{n - 1}} + \frac{|\mathcal A_{n - 1}|}{\binom{n}{n - 2}} \leq 1,
  \]
  so
  \[
    \frac{|\mathcal A_n|}{\binom{n}{n}} + \frac{|\mathcal A_{n - 1}|}{\binom{n}{n - 1}} + \frac{|\mathcal A_{n - 2}|}{\binom{n}{n - 2}} \leq 1
  \]
  Keep going we have the result desired.
\end{proof}

Again we can ask when we have equality in LYM inequality. This happens if and only if we have equality in each use of local LYM, so the ``first'' (greatest) \(r\) with \(\mathcal A_r \neq \emptyset\) must have \(\mathcal A_r = X^{(r)}\) so \(\mathcal A = X^{(r)}\). Thus we know equality in Sperner's lemma (\(\mathcal A = X^{(n/2)}\) for \(n\) even, similar for \(n\) odd)
